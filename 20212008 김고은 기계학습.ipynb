       "'this a fantastic white wine for any occasion tart  not sweet very refreshing and delicious i was given this wine so it was a delightful surprise to find that it has a flavorful and delicious taste  a new favorite this is a phenomenal wine and my new favorite red   ml bottles for the price of two with way less packaging yes please  i was nervous it was too good to be true and i wouldn t like the wine but it s fantastic  i have to go a bit out of my way to get it  i live near a state line and it isn t sold in my state due to liquor laws  but it s worth it i love becks na  it tastes just like a regular ale  it smells like one too  it tastes great  it s the only na that i drink  my friends love it too  it has a great head when you pour this wine has a wonderful but strong aroma its a bit bitter has a bite to it but still goodit was worth it in the end i would give one more star if it came clean on the bottle and called itself a  sweet red  instead it get s poetic and grandiose about itself when all it is is a blend which  standard practice  gets a dash of grape juice concentrate to sweeten it  it also looses a star for the price  i rather look to the side of my target s shelves and pick up a lambrusco for about   less delicious and very affordable this is a very smooth red with aromas of cocoa  coffee  tobacco sweet black cherry  bold but soft  i highly recommend this one based on positive reviews  i served all of the fancy pants varieties at a recent party  my guests and i loved them  since i am not a wine expert  i will provide some details on this variety from the fancy pants website   is like sunshine in the glass  its brisk and bright  with inviting citrus  melon and passion fruit aromas leading to mouthwatering grapefruit and zesty lime flavors with hints of minerality on the palate  vibrant acidity and a crisp  clean finish make this wine a versatile partner for a wide range of foodsespecially succulent seafood  mediterranean style grilled vegetables  and salads  served well chilled  our sauvignon blanc is fun and friendlythe perfect pour for sunny afternoons and picnics nice fruity and sweet taking sparkling wine  goes great in mimosa  you have to try it to see how you will like it  even the guys would enjoy this at your wedding a rich amber ale with a subtle but noticeable hop character  great beer to pair with food this light bodied ipa is dry hopped with cascade for a bold and bright hp aroma  balanced by a refreshing and crisp ale  great for a cookout out day at the beach  love it this light bodied ipa is dry hopped with cascade for a bold and bright hp aroma  balanced by a refreshing and crisp ale  great for a cookout out day at the beach  love it great for a perfect summer day or a get together with the girls i m not sure if this is a bad bottle or if it was intentionally made effervescent  i don t want bubbles when i drink pinot grigio  goes well with mozzarella string cheese and cinemasins obsessed with this new drink however  it has been sold out at every target i have been to lately  this is an excellent red wine  not to dry and not real sweet  more of a red blend  great go with anything anytime  in the right price point as other known brands on the market one of the best cabernets i had in quite sometime this is a great buy for the price  someone had given me a bottle and i liked the look of it so much that i didn t want to open it  had no idea it was so nicely priced and so easily available  finally opened it when i was in a bind  needing white wine for a favorite holiday recipe and this was all i had on hand  it s a nice  smooth pinot  very nice flavor  pleasurable to the palate  what i especially love about this brand  however  is the bottle itself  screw off the black top and there is a smaller neck with a cork closure  the beauty is that the black cap is designed so that it will reseal the bottle without the cork needing to be squeezed back in a really thoughtful design  i almost hate to admit how much i was impressed by it  will be stopping by target specifically to buy more to have in the house  highly recommend gluten free plus lower on calories plus very refreshing best of the bunch of all of the wine cube sku s  target wine buyer  please bring back i like the wine and i like the idea of a sealed cube during the week when only drinking a glass or two at a time  but when they re sized the box a few months ago  it made it impossible to open and setup properly  while i applaud target for reducing the packaging  this just isn t working i have tried my share of moscato d  astis before  this has to be the smoothest that i have ever tried  not too sweet or too fizzy but perfect  i got it for the pretty bottle but was very surprised about the taste  try it  you won t be disappointed highly  highly recommend  it s sweet but not syrupy  just right  and i love that it s bubbly  i don t have to mix my wine with seltzer anymore my favorite bottle design  the best cheap lager delicious  i hate all the other flavors but this one tastes great  now if i can only find it in the store this wine is amazing  i m an avid wine drinker  mom life  and i ll continue to buy this for sure  for   it s a steal  keep this around please  it s just another reason to love target love it that it s not too dry or overly sweet  also has a good balance of alcohol this wine was sooooo good  i usually don t like cabernet but this special fermented wine is very tasty  it did not stay around too long lol some of the best boxed wine i have ever tasted  great taste and great value love this moscato and will be purchasing more on my next target run  let it chill in the fridge and enjoy on a hot summer day had my sissies  sistafriends  over for dinner planning meeting and they re still talking about the loving fellowship and the great wine  i hope the store has more than   bottle left on its shelves great fruity dry rose is this the greatest wine in the world  of course not  it is an eminently drinkable wine as a matter of fact it is my preferred  and go to  table wine  wine is a personal thing but for me it is my   pick in the under   category  it is well balanced  subtle  and very easy to sip  dry without being overpowering  it is not a big bad cabernet but it is not that in a good way  goes great by itself or paired with cheese or a dish sauced with something heavier like a bernaise  i always have a bottle on my shelf delicious white wine  light  crisp  not too sweet  almost too good just bad wine  the worst i have ever had  try bota box sarah is you are looking for a decent boxed wine i am no wine expert by any means  but i love a good red for dinner or a cold night  this is the ticket  rich  dark  fruity  just lovely  the hubby liked it too best wine i ever tasted not fruity  very satisfying  my go to chardonnay  excellent product   would expect to pay     bottle for this quality picked some up on a trip to the beach as they are portable non breakable and priced right  i didn t know what to expect  honestly  my expectations were not too high  being boxed wine and all  i was pleasantly surprised  it is very drinkable delicious  when i got home i returned to target to get the large wine cube box for at home enjoyment by far the best boxed wine i ve found  and comparable to medium priced bottled sauvignon blancs  a great buy by far the best boxed wine i ve found  and comparable to medium priced bottled sauvignon blancs  a great buy taste was absolutely fine for a   chardonnay  however  both bottles broke while removing the corkscrew  second break was far enough i didn t want to risk drinking it because of risk of glass shards  i ve bought cheaper wines like yellowtail  etc  and never experienced a bottle breaking i didnt find this to be sweet at all  but everyones taste differs  i usually dont like sweet wines so i gravitate towards chardonnay and some sauvignon blancs and i felt like this one had more of a buttery taste than a sweet citrusy taste like another reviewer stated  for the price  this is definitely a keeper my boyfriend brought this home on a whim  we were delighted at how tasty it was  lasted us a couple weeks   even better i love disaronno  it has a smooth texture and the flavor is lightly sweet  it s decadent on the rocks or with a little cream i m surprised how good this is for the price  tastes more like sauvignon blanc to me nice  light wine   i was not sure what to expect but was surprised how well it tasted for a   bottle for as much as we drink white wine  i needed to find a budget bottle  we d been doing   dollar bottles  but this beats that  and it s pretty good  you won t impress anyone with this  but for a monday thursday  home and on a budget drinking  this is good i served this and all the different varieties at a party  my guests and i loved them all  since i am not a wine expert  i will simply give you some of the notes on this variety from the fancy pants website   a robust and rich palate with ripe berries  red fruit  and toasty oak flavors  cherries and vanilla spice on the mouth lead to a long  lingering finish i tried beringer  who makes this  pink moscato  had no trouble opening it up with a corkscrew  one which i just bought from target in store  really like its sweet  fruity flavor pink looking wine  i plan to stock up for the holidays if you like a fruit forward blend of reds with a very smooth finish and jammy taste  you will love this  i think my   year search for my favorite red wine has ended this is a dry rose  not sweet at all which is perfect for summer a wonderful dry wine  and the taste is just divine a wonderful dry wine  and the taste is just divine been looking for strongbow in the us for years refreshing  nice grapefruit flavor  not for people that dislike seltzer water  it s good out of the can or poured over ice it is not sweet and i like that  if you like the taste of sparkling water with the benefit of   alcohol  this is for you best cabernet i ve ever tasted  simple as that so refreshing  loveit this cayman jack margarita is really good  i found it in a southern california target  but i can t find it in northern california stores   i expected this beer to be on the bitter side the first time i tried it  but i still enjoyed its smooth taste  i d definitely buy it if i get a chance looked like a linear regulator from outside and no reviews on it so i ordered this puppy to put it to the test  definitely a switcher and fairly quiet  well regulated just like all of rm italy products  great quality i love sparkling wine  but i find that most brands are sweet  i m aging and no longer want the sweet stufd  this is medium body wine with strong bubbles  i love bubbles     the alcohol content offers a nice buzz fairly quickly  so ecstatic i found this brand and target carries it i served this at my baby shower and everyone went crazy over it  it s an inexpensive gem this wine is full bodied and delicious super wine with fruity taste  as a regular wine drinker this is our routine wine of choice  priced right with good taste had a taste of either being old or spoiled  stick with the bottle this is our go to wine for dinner parties  better than most of the   bottles i have been enjoying jim beam original for many years  i started mixing jb o with slice while wife and i watched dallas  i have tried other whiskeys  but keep coming back to jb  now i enjoy it mixed with diet pepsi  since i can no longer find slice it goes great in apple cider consistent flavor and quality  jb with dr  pepper is surprisingly tasty  i highly recommend it  love your commercials  too  mila is doing you proud  keep up the good work a true classic of spirits i love this bourbon as it is always my first choice when its time to unwind  whether its neat  on rocks  with a coke or ginger ale  or my grandpa s whiskey sour  nothing tops jim beam  nothing the white label or the devil s cut dashed with some lemonade and lime cordial is how i enjoy my jim best drink you can get to make manhattens best bourbon i have found have toured distillery and love the brand red stag and coke zero is my go to drink  only wish more bars and restaurants stocked it  nothing like a good bourbon with a cherry kick  i like it with dr peper to sip and relax better than the other s drank it for years and always smooth and tasty  now it is running off the shelves at our liquor store i keep jim beam on hand every day of the week i typically have this neat or with an ice cube  its light amber appearance  sweet  woody  mossy nose  and its mild moss  white oak  mellow wintergreen mint  and dried  faintly candied fruit flavor draws the drinker into an exploration of pin point distilling execution  jim beam original has a gradual finish  with a ghost of chocolate powder  during the fade out  highly recommended  rjt it s does have a great toaste to it the only drink i ll drink i had a neat   finger glass two weeks ago of jb black label for the first time  i ve always drank jack daniels  and i loved it  no more jack for me best tasteing and defenetly the smoothest around i love it i always keep a bottle of jim bean in my liquor cabinet  value for price is incredible and it mixes great this is our favorite mixed drink whiskey and sams has the best price on a handle  we ll be buying this again best whiskey around and a price that can t be beat to make manhattens best bourbon i have found have toured distillery and love the brand i drink yellow tail because you can not buy a perfect wine for the price of this one  i just love it i always buy this item at walmart cause they always have it at a great price as a scotch drinker  tasting basil hayden s for the first time changed my opinion of bourbons  now i enjoy both scotch bourbon with bh on the top of list for bourbons very tasty bourbon basil hayden was my gateway to world of burbon  ever since i have held its flavor profile as the gold standard when trying others on the market bit i always find myself coming back to my first love outstanding  simply an outstanding beverage  spicy and light with a comforting finish  a staple in my home bar rotation   i never let a bottle get near empty without backfilling it with a fresh one i love the cooks champagne however i cannot drink the brut  would love extra dry to become available at sams in mobile al my favorite red wine has been menage a trois for a long time  and this silk blend is even better than the regular blend  the price has remained affordable while the quality has remained consistently good for these red blends my mother turned me on to barefoot riesling a few years back and it had been a reflex to always choose it when given the option been trying to find a red wine with a smooth finish  this stuff is exactly what i was looking for perfect sipping tequila   chilled and neat  perfect sipping tequila   chilled and neat  my buddy ordered some shots of this stuff during a horns game  frankly when it comes to tequila  i usually brace myself for a rough shot  maybe i m drinking the wrong stuff  because this was really easy to put back  no lingering aftertaste  reasonably priced  good value tequila if you re looking straight over ice my drink of choice when i really want to enjoy my time alone makes orange jello taste like creamsicle  strawberry taste like strawberries and cream  lemon taste like lemon meringue i could go on and on get some today pinnacle has been making our martini s in my family for many years  my late father discovered it years ago when someone said it s on par with that vodka that flys south for the winter  but at a very reasonable price  try it  bet you ll love it too  al the whipped creme flavored vodka is fabulous  i keep it in the freezer and have a snifter of it when i want something smooth after dinner or as a night cap  love it everything is great about this product  cheap price  perfect taste  mixing this flavor with just a soda makes it delicious i love this vodka  i have been drinking vodka for many years  and this is by far one of the best  and my favorite vodka  i drink it regularly  usually with grape juice  but also with orange juice  we use it to make daiquiris  and many other frozen concoctions just so so  seems to be missing something  there are much better margarita mixes out there without all the additives this does not have very good summer red  it s become our favorite reasonably priced wine that we enjoy on its own love all of the flavors  will be buying again  great for summer drinks i bought this pack on a whim and i m so glad i did  there is a variety of drinks for a great price  even less than the discount liquor store  i ll definitely get this again vrty good jamaican me happy really enjoy these but sams likes to send you on wild goose chases saying available and none to be found not even the empty pallet we have been buying apothic dark for a couple of years now  it is our red blend of choice  very smooth and very reasonably priced decent table wine for the price  bend that is on the sweeter side of the spectrum rum chata is great when mixed with fireball or caramel vodka love this brand of tequila  i m a margarita fan and like to make different kinds love it wouldnt mind drinking more on a hot day near the water  this is the cheap ish beer to have  bud light with a solid splash of lime  makes it a light and refreshing choice  the target  pack is average priced and will provide a beverage most will enjoy   particularly the ladies love this vodka   it s perfect for screwdrivers  it blends so well with the juice and for an interesting citrus blend  you can use grapefruit juice we ve been drinking this wine for a while  it s one of a group we buy regularly because it s a good wine at an affordable price never disappointed  constant taste a delicious blended wine   give it a try  you might be surprised this is by far the best reisling i ve ever had  love it  always consistent in flavor and my go to great taste don t forget a slice of orage on the side very fruity  smooth  i like it straight over ice with a bit of chambord this is my favorite riesling  when i spotted it on sale for   a bottle i was delighted  i usually pay around   at other locations  buying two bottles saved me six dollars  thanks target refreshing taste of beer especially for summer  citrus combined w  blueberry right on target   sierra nevada torpedo ale has outstanding character  warm  subtle hints of fruit and a strong but not overly bitter hop aftertaste  it is excellent after a hard day s work to kick back and relax  target recently began carrying beer and i could not be more enthused   best beer for the money  wish the club in omaha would carry it again  any idea if any club carries it battle ground walmart is to high priced to surrounding stores any alcohol beverage i have been enjoying jim beam original for many years  i started mixing jb o

our party special  everyone was pleased with our choice of drinks taste drink this is by far the best flavored vodka on the market  i drink it with soda water the flavor is crisp  not sweet or thick at all it s really smooth but the taste isn t so good  more on the cough syrup side than black cherry and vanilla  it was a waste of money  the green apple and blood orange are the best ones  it s

agave light golden syrup an one lime over ice with gold sauza tequila perfect drink i use with blue agave light golden syrup an one lime over ice with gold sauza tequila perfect drink starborough was a surprise as an alternate to fume blanc or grigio wines  this is a soft and above average tasty white wine  citrus aroma  gracious acidity  layered texture is enough to satisfy chardonnay as an alternate crisp finish and a nice experience no matter how many different whiskey s there is  not a one  so far  has been able to resist my taste for the love  f jim beam your product is the smoothest going down  and make great gifts i use jim beam to make alot of different kinds of marinades and sauces  i make a honey bourbon marinade for smoking jerky that tastes amazing  everyone says it s the best jerky they ve ever had  thanks for making the best bourbon on the market jim beam wife and i enjoy it mixed with a coke or a monster black cherry  excellent this is my favorite bourbon  i even love its aroma  it has that nice vanilla scent going on  i never get tired of jim beam black i m a single malt scotch guy  i generally have two fingers neat with a quality cigar about once a week  on a stressful day  i ll have a couple of beers or so after work before the family gets home  the trouble is the beer gut that comes with that trend  i was looking for something similar to my favorite scotch  which is a little out of my budget to drink daily  jim beam black is an awesome substitute with the rich white oak aroma and flavor  it isn t near as smooth as my favorite scotch  but the flavor is on point  thank you jim beam for putting this great whiskey out there at an affordable price  you ve got a customer for life exceptionally good flavor no matter where i go after years of various bourbon tastings jim beam black is head and shoulders above the rest no matter what the price tag i m personally a wild turkey drinker  but cudos to jim beam for producing such a classy commercial  got the right girl to be their spokesperson  good job  very classy seriously you ask what s great about it what isn t great about it no explanation necessary i first started drinking jim bean when i went camping  i didnt want to carry the bear around so i tried jim bean  my first was red stag cherry  than i tried devils cut when i came home  i have been hooked ever since  i usually mix with coke or dr pepper this is the best bourbon under   you can buy  one of the smoothest bourbons i ve tasted  i typically drink woodford reserve or eagle rare until i tried this  i buy a bottle every two weeks now this is beam at it s best very smooth i tried jb black for the first time tonight  it is so smooth  we made whiskey sours with it and they were awesome  thanks jim beam for this awesome bourbon i have been enjoying jb black for the past three years  the has all the flavor os a higher proof  bur   i can have another without collapsing  now it has disappeared from even the most extensive liquor stores in my area  what happened the double oaked is ok  but no match for the black  where can i find it in sonoma county  california i bought this in early december and it didn t make it to the new year  this one is awesome  keep up the great work absolutely love  love  love it no explanation necessary to bad they just raised the price   i won t buy it now one of the best on the shelf for under  i purchased this item to make mimosas and had some left over  the mimosas were delicious  i found the california champaign tasteless when too cold and just right at a lesser temperature  of course it is not dom perignon but who would make mimosas with dom  anyway my drink of choice when i really want to enjoy my time alone pinnacle has been making our martini s in my family for many years  my late father discovered it years ago when someone said it s on par with that vodka that flys south for the winter  but at a very reasonable price  try it  bet you ll love it too  al the whipped creme flavored vodka is fabulous  i keep it in the freezer and have a snifter of it when i want something smooth after dinner or as a night cap  love it i love this vodka  i have been drinking vodka for many years  and this is by far one of the best  and my favorite vodka  i drink it regularly  usually with grape juice  but also with orange juice  we use it to make daiquiris  and many other frozen concoctions great run to mix up the rocking fun  get some today and mix away  you won t be disappointed love it  great tast if i m going to buy a sangria  this is not the one i d choose  the flavor was not as fruity as others i ve had and was not pleasant for my palate we are not big wine drinkers but we love this stuff  it is just sweet enough and not as bitter as regular wine and you can really taste the fruity undertones  the price is nice as well  recommended the is absolutely the best sangria ever  hoping sam s continues to carry it  i buy six bottles each visit i have searched high as low for this sangria and it is by far the best tasting  it is not too sweet  and very smooth  i love it chilled because its perfect for a hot summer s day i purchase this every time i go to sam s  then is started to disappear  this last time we went  there was a mini case of six bought them all  scared that something this good might not re appear  please reassure us that you will continue to carry it no after taste love this wine have you ever just wanted a wine that gives you that fruity juicy taste without the hard alcohol kick well this is it still gives you that cocktail buzz without that hard taste  love this stuff even my very picky grandmother loves it what a delightful surprise  excellent taste and aroma  nice after finish i love cabernet and merlot wines  i couldn t even finish a glass of this stuff and that s saying a lot we have been drinking this wine for   years  it s just a good every day table wine that will not break the bank i m a wine girl from way back  had a lot of pricey wines  some i liked  some i poured down the drain  same with cheaper wine usually i stay right in the middle to be happiest  however  a close friend recommended this one to me a couple of years ago as a nice  everyday wine  and i have to say that for those purposes  this is one of my favorites it s not often that you come across a wine this bad  i ve tasted cooking wines that were better  unfortunately  my wife bought four bottles of this stuff  tried to return it  but sam s wouldn t accept it  not that i blame them  i d pour it down the sink  but it might damage the pipes  sigh i am not happy they only carry cans  the bottles are much better bring them back please yummmmmmyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy this beer is delicious  but i have to tell you that it is quite sweet  so if you don t like cream soda  you won t like it  in my case  it is perfect and i absolutely love it it was very fresh and cheaper than anywhere in the area i bought this  best price and great convenience to order online  pick up in store  great job  super easy made our party special  everyone was pleased with our choice of drinks really enjoy  no strong tannin after taste  ok price  we pull out a bottle to have w  pizza  red sauce dishes  found this to be a smooth red w  meals everyone i share this with  loves it  great tasting and soft  with no harsh aftertaste i bought two bottles of meiomi and give one to a friend  i enjoyed drinking my bottle but was wondering if it can be aged i just bought a fifth of jim beam apple and mixed it with ice cold mtn dew  it was great especially if you add a twist of fresh lemon we buy this bottle every week but the only thing we do not like is that every time you take the top off it leaves a black residue in the drink and a gross smell on your hand from twisting the top off   if you guys could fix that then it would be twice more amazing i went to my local store to purchase another apple flavored product but saw this decided to purchase jim beam apple instead  i m glad that i did  i mix my jim beam with cranberry juice and if i want it to be a little fizzy i ll add some seagram s ginger ale  love this drink and will be purchasing more soon i was hesitant to buy jim beam apple  after trying other apple whiskeys  but i was not disappointed  it s so smooth  light and fruity  very good i mix the jim beam apple with a little ginger ale  it is a great summer refreshment first time trying it i love it  great tasting smooth blend  awesome price too sip then have an orange slice need salt or a lime but the addition of it makes it even better drink very good flavor without a over powering finish  never need salt or a lime but the addition of it makes it even better one of my favorite silver tequilas use for shots this is hands down my favorite tequila  amazing taste at an amazing price  no lime salt needed drink very good flavor without a over powering finish  never need salt or a lime but the addition of it makes it even better one of my favorite silver tequilas this is a fruity dessert wine  since i had my first taste of a gewurtztraminer wine i have bought wine from this grape from   different countries  and vineyards  this fetzer gewurtztraminer has the best flavor and body of all the ones i ve tried  it s hard to find  but worth trying  if you ve never tried a wine from this grape before best beer on market  mans beer  leaves hoppy aftertaste  approx    cals per   oz  maintain exercise if drinking two or more per day it will add weight great refreshing taste  not a weak beer  safe ingredients that are non gmo yuck  i m the type who usually rants and raves over trump brands  but this wine is awful  was so shocked  i spilled it all over my favorite brown shirt  sad best  beer  ever  end of review great value awesome taste just can t be beat my favorite chardonney my momma loves this stuff  its the taste that will rockur socks off i have been enjoying jim beam

ale  or my grandpa s whiskey sour  nothing tops jim beam  nothing to make manhattens best bourbon i have found have toured distillery and love the brand very smooth sweet wine  just wish wine companies would mark wine with dry  medium dry  sweet  extra sweet i was told at a wine store that this wine is more of a mix of two different red wines  other then the fact that it leaves a bit of red on my lips even after i ve finished drinking i loved it  if you enjoy bitter red wines this is pretty good  i ve tried many cheaper bitter red wines and the price point and quality of this so far has been great  i d definitely suggest giving this a try you just might like it at a great price i been drinking riunite for years it s great with food  partying with friends and family  or just relaxing  i will be buying it for the holidays to go with my gumbo this wine taste really good  i love the soft flavor  i will buy this again this is the wine  at a wonderful club price  why isn t the rosa and other ones carried by sam s this wine is amazing it s not too sweet not to bitter  it is a great inexpensive wine fruity  full body  cheap  go well with asian foods  if you are looking to buy a red for wedding  this is the one  i got so many compliments from my anniversary this year on this red  if you want the cheaper wine  sure  you can go with veo or menage a trois though  carnivor is still a great wine i bought this wine for my christmas party and everyone loved it  especially the guests who d never had wine before  bartenura moscato beat out all the other kinds that i d set out

is  i wanted to try a silver  and picked this up on a gamble  at half the price of what i normally buy    agava smooth tasted like tequila should solana blanco is a very mild tasting tequila  if you see it on a walmart shelf  grab it and try it  you will not be disappointed  it flies off the shelf at my store maple crown is by far my favorite whiskey to date  it goes great with coca cola products  a must buy tastes like juice that makes you unwind  perfect for that end of the day glass  i only wish it were easier to find  my local store is often out of stock i m a single malt scotch guy  i generally have two fingers neat with a quality cigar about once a week  on a stressful day  i ll have a couple of beers or so after work before the family gets home  the trouble is the beer gut that comes with that trend  i was looking for something similar to my favorite scotch  which is a little out of my budget to drink daily  jim beam black is an awesome substitute with the rich white oak aroma and flavor  it isn t near as smooth as my favorite scotch  but the flavor is on point  thank you jim beam for putting this great whiskey out there at an affordable price  you ve got a customer for life exceptionally good flavor no matter where i go after years of various bourbon tastings jim beam black is head and shoulders above the rest no matter what the price tag i m personally a wild turkey drinker  but cudos to jim beam for producing such a classy commercial  got the right girl to be their spokesperson  good job  very classy seriously you ask what s great about it what isn t great about it no explanation necessary i first started drinking jim bean when i went camping  i didnt want to carry the bear around so i tried jim bean  my first was red stag cherry  than i tried devils cut when i came home  i have been hooked ever since  i usually mix with coke or dr pepper this is the best bourbon under   you can buy  one of the smoothest bourbons i ve tasted  i typically drink woodford reserve or eagle rare until i tried this  i buy a bottle every two weeks now this is beam at it s best very smooth i tried jb black for the first time tonight  it is so smooth  we made whiskey sours with it and they were awesome  thanks jim beam for this awesome bourbon i have been enjoying jb black for the past three years  the has all the flavor os a higher proof  bur   i can have another without collapsing  now it has disappeared from even the most extensive liquor stores in my area  what happened the double oaked is ok  but no match for the black  where can i find it in sonoma county  california i bought this in early december and it didn t make it to the new year  this one is awesome  keep up the great work absolutely love  love  love it i really like this soda  it has a sweet  earthy apple flavor  and a bite that warms your tummy  i have already shared this with a friend  who also loved it  i would definitely buy this again  and probably will soon it is a very good drink it has a marvolous taste and a very good value including that it is non alcoholic i recomend it to any one who wants to ahve a drink without the hangover and the risk of getting drunk great for cooking full of flavor spice no need to add all of the extras except vodka of course this is by far the best bloody mary mix on the market the only thing you will have to add is your preferred garnish and lime if you like it  tastes great w o alcohol  just on the rocks too great mix just the right amount of spice not only is this item great for bloody mary s  but it s super for chili lots of great taste all in one mix i like the product because you can drink it straight for a refreshing drink over ice   since told about the product i have made several purchases and recommend this for a different drink of choice used at birthday party and everyone enjoyed it  will purchase again love the flavor and the spice  great bloody mary s or red beer great for bloody mary s or a dressed chelada love it i do however wish they had it in individual servings no bitter after taste  just spicy enough  price was a good price best bloody mary mix ever this is not an easy find  so glad jet has it  this review was collected as part of a promotion did not buy for any special occasion but great to have around to mix up when friends come by  this review was collected as part of a promotion i really enjoy drinks made with mr  mrs  t  sometimes i mix half bloody mary mix and either v  or clamto juice  tastes great great product at a great price no other brand comes close to the excellent taste not very tasty at all this is great i ve been drinking this stuff since i was a little kid and i am in my  s now  clamato is delicious  very unique taste that i love  i can chug this stuff faster than water  i d sponsor clamato if i could  lol what has to happened clamato over the past few months i have noticed a distinct difference in the taste of clamato original  there seems to be less clam juice taste and more tomato and sweet taste  is it just me or has anyone else noticed i want more clam hello i wanted to know if this drink has an expiration date because i dont see it   or how long can it last ecen when is not open and when it is it s tasty and with beer and vodka or by its self and drink it just about with every day i lke drink it   a glass white lime and salt  taste so good  and no more hangover love it  recommend to all bloody drinkers  tell everybody to try it dark ales  specially british  and clamato  picante or original mineral water  topo chico  with limn and salt and clamato best thing ever i ve been drinking for over   years love this stuff and you can drink by itself better flavor than v  have a glass every morning for breakfast love to have  once bud light with  onces of clamato my dad introduced me to this years ago when mixing up bloody mary s as a bartender for   plus years clamato is still my favorite for bloody marys and red beer  yum very good refreshing and would highly recommend to friends and family had it as an appetizer   years ago and drank it ever since i simply love clamato   its simply delicious  however  the sodium content is so high that i do not drink it at all anymore  if a low sodium version was made it would be the only product of this nature i would purchase this product as well as many others would be more appealing to me and others if the hfcs was replaced with cane sugar  you have a good product and there are ways to make it better  an increase in price would not deter me in the least  look at the growth of the organic industry  need i say more my husband has been drinking this for a few years he does enjoy it way tastier than v without a doubt  the only way to make an authentic michelada i love this stuff it needs to be cheeper and not so much salt other then that i drink it like water lol its awesome stuff the best mix i have ever used for bloody mary just need to spice it up a little with flavored vodka try it you will love it lime juice  tapatio sauce clamato juice and bud light good stuff  good by itself  anytime breakfast   lunch and dinner hello i wanted to know if this drink has an expiration date because i dont see it   or how long can it last ecen when is not open and when it is clamato almost seems like they are embarrassed this great cocktail is seasoned with clams  i wish there were more clam juice in it  as they never mention that part of the name sake  be proud you created such an awesome drink and it is indeed seasoned with clam juice put more in please i love this juice  it makes great red beers  bloody mary s  red bulls  etc  plus it is great just by itself i was shyed away at first from clamato  strange enough  i love bloody mary s and all i eat is seafood  so  one would think  clams and tomato juice wouldn t be a problem  well  i made my own bloody caesar with clamato at home  a touch of cracked pepper  hot sauce  old bay seasoning  and it was fantastic this is a good price on this item  this review was collected as part of a promotion nice i use clamato to make bloody mary s    clamato    vodka    zingzang  mix and enjoy i bought this for my   year old grandson  he loves it and says it taste very good i like this way better than tomato juice packaging was awkward but understandable addictively tasty i love this product as i have chronic kidney disease and it is allowed for me  i only wish that i could find a coupon for it like i do for v  that isn t good for me i really like clamato juice  i tried it because i thought that the savory notes of clam juice would be refreshing  and it really is the most delicious  refreshing  salty drink ever  i ve made sure to always keep a bottle in the fridge very good i fell in love with clamato over   yrs ago  my mom drank it and so i was introduced to it at a young age  now as an adult i absolutely love it alone or mixing it up for some micheladas with my pops  we always have at least   bottles in the fridge i have been drinking clamato for years and using it as a mixer for years  nothing else compares  bring back beefmoto i have diabetes and chronic kidney disease and i love clamato juice cocktail and it is good for my kidney and my diabetes  i have at least one glass a day very refreshing served iced cold best item i have ever purchased  hands down  so delicious  words can t do it justice  my favorite part is the clams  and also the tomato  how is it possible to unite two vastly different flavor a in such a harmonizing blend i don t know  but the result is beautiful and so delicious  i will definitely purchase again  actually i am on the way right now  walmart that is  to buy clamato clamato does not have a distinct clam flavor it s refreshing and with a nice balance to the tomato and clam and lime and spices  it s a nice alternative to v  or tomato juice and works well in a cocktail blend this is my favorite beverage  do not be afraid of the clam and tomato mix  it is fantastic  we drink a container per week  some as bloody mary  caesar  it has to be popular because walmart is frequently sold out  i have tried the picante version  but the original is the best makes great bloody marys the clamato cocktail is the best juice i have tasted in a long time  i have a small glass with every dinner  good flavor  great taste this is the absolute best tomato juice to use in a bloody mary  because it contains clam juice  the drink is called a clam digger  buy this all the time  mix it with vodka  worcestershire sauce  lemon juice and hot sauce  best drink being from canada it so so good to see motts clamato juice was available at walmart  we all know you can t make a ceasar without it  there is a difference  a ceasar is made with clamato juice  a bloody mary is with tomato juice i didnt like the idea of clam and tomato juice  but tried it anyway  i was pleasantly surprised with its refreshing taste  whether it is served over ice  or as a part of a mixed drink  it is excellent is good by its self or added to your favorite hop beverage  i only use clamoto for my shrimp cocteau s and drinks  love the freshness i love clamato  i can t have alcohol due to health issues  but i make a mean virgin drink  add celery salt and a couple squeezes of lime juice  stir with a celery stalk  yum great value on this size bottle it s far from natural    clam powder  but delicious this is good as drinking alone or mixing with your choice of other beverages my husband loves to use this as an ingredient for mexican shrimp cocktail it s delicious  he also enjoys to drink it alone love this stuff  very tasty very smooth and light flavor was a hit the town at the end i love become the clam and tomato blend with in this product i have been a user of clamato for quite a while  i was glad to find i could order it from walmart online as it is not always available in our store excellent flavor   i drink it by itself  but mostly i use this to make my bloody mary s  i love to buy clamato at walmart the price is very good and the product is good i buy it for my micheladas clamato almost seems like they are embarrassed this great cocktail is seasoned with clams  i wish there were more clam juice in it  as they never mention that part of the name sake  be proud you created such an awesome drink and it is indeed seasoned with clam juice put more in please this is great  we use cream of coconut often  we hate to have to buy cans that we can save after use  this coco real product allows to use the amount needed and save the rest  the taste of coco real is wonderful  we ve used it for drinks and even on burgers  never a complaint they were a big hit at my daughters wedding i love this stuff  i add vodka and freeze  then scoop out and its a great slushi the mix inside the container smells very similar to kool aid  it is a good sugary drink mix when access to a blender or the time to make a homemade product is unavailable  it s decent for the price though my guest seemed to like it  a word of caution before pouring anything into the bucket carefully inspect the bottom of the bucket and spout for damage  on one of these my bucket was uknowlingly damaged and i lost a substantial amount as my margarita dripped out into the freezer    cheers if you love frozen drinks this is easy preparation and great tasting  not just for parties we added rum and this made a great refreshing dink to have my the pool had to order online  not offered in store  wish they had these in the store  shipping was quick and prompt  showed up in store a day early  perfect for game night  delicious  easy to make the taste is awesome excellent this should be available in store it was very similar to what i had gotten before at xmas tree shop so was happy with that  same ease of mixing too  same taste  but while waiting for it to be delivered i found it at market basket for less money plus i would have saved the shipping this is the best strawberry margarita daiquiri mix on the market  it s hard to find  it s a shame walmart stopped carrying it in their stores my husband says he loves the flavor tastes delicious with or without vodka it is the best sence snappy tom god and tasty love the extra kick i have been drinking it for quite awhile  like it better than hot v can t beat the deal  this review was collected as part of a promotion it s delicious i would highly recommend it i use this for cooking  just enough kick shipped well without spillage  love this product in place of v being from louisiana  love the spicy excellent i biy it by the case every week this is so nice having the big bottle of bloody mary mix  can t find this in the store most of the time and even when they carry the large bottle it is usually in the original flavor and not the spicy  good deal compared to other places if you are looking for a spicy bloody mary this mix is great i enjoyed the flavor we have tried several different bloody mary mixes and have found this one to be the one we like the best a friend told me about this product and i tried it and i loved it  i wish that i had knew about it sooner tasty excellent  thick and rich with just the right amount of kick  i always ordered this on the jets when i travelled it s really good  right amputated of spice if you like spicey i loved it  not too spicy just enough kick  way better than the original not spicy at all but does the job by far the best mix for a good bloody mary  i love the flavor this product did not have any flavor  it was very bland to call itself spicy i think they are putting too much sucrose in the mix  while good it would be better with less sweetness a well balanced and good tasting mix  i would recommend this mix we love the smooth  bubbly taste  we drink it with orange juice for brunch every weekend  without the oj  it s just as delicious paired with seafood or a girls night out so good  i like the hotter bourbons  and at   there is nothing better at this price point  this is like a stagg jr that you can actually find at retail price  or find at all  underrated  and i just assume it stays that way i am a single malt scotch aficianado  recently i have decided to embrace my american heritage by trying bourbons  in the back of my mind  i had the suspicion  that such nationalistic ideals are doomed to fail but oh my goodness  the knob creek kentucky straight is everything i have desired  rich  mellow  fruity  and sufficiently heavy to keep me light knob creek has become my go to  mixed with ginger ale or straight  you can t go wrong with knob creek s kentucky straight bourbon whiskey one of my simple pleasures in life is a knob creek   proof on the rocks  it is fantastic i have loved it since the first time i tried it  however  in my country it s not sold  in a recent trip abroad  i finally found it and bought a bottle  now i m looking forward to share it with friends  wonderful bourbon straight or on ice  smooth and no bite from the first sniff in the glass to finally reaching my lips  aaa  bourbon  very happy with my purchase  i ve already told my buddies to come by for a taste for   proof  this bourbon is sweet and mellow  the slight burn at the finish reminds you that you are still alive previous bottles stated aged nine years  last bottle purchased shows no age  taste appeared a little harsher than previously this is a superb quality whiskey  my go to this is a go to bourbon for me  a friend recommended the   year as a good  full bodied bourbon at a really good price and needless to say it didn t disappoint  i typically have either neat or at times over an  oversized  ice cube  either way  i get really good  smooth flavors  somewhat woody  somewhat caramel ly  and enjoy it on a regular basis  i consider this to be one the best bourbons for a really good price a bright amber dram that is bold yet soft on the back of the tongue and lights a fire on the way down  the nose is a velvety riot of vanilla and caramel that finishes with a hint of sour mash  it is the kind of whiskey that a man would choose to enjoy after a hunt or after a wake to remember good times and good friends wow  what a punch  yet smooth enough to enjoy this tastes great for the price and is as close to the captain as i have found i bought   of these for a small wedding dinner  went over well  this is a standard sweet sparkling asti with consistent quality and reasonable price year after year good price and product light crispy flavor  very refreshing add a little salt and it is perfect this tastes amazing  so far the best from jasper s the magic potion is just annoying to brew with  when you add it to the beer it turns into a mucusy substance and you need to strain it out which is really hard  other than that it is great i haven t had a chance to brew this beer  but everything about the process has been great so far  they are in state  so the package arrived timely and the protective shipping package was superb  the kit even has a funny coffee stain on it with a note basically saying they wont explain   but it s important  funny detail  and gives me a sense of their personality  also  due to this specific brew   you can probably expect your box to smell as absolutely jaw droppingly amazing as mine  spice  malts  sweetness  ughhhh  i keep opening and closing the box and sniffing the bags so much that my girlfriend is getting annoyed the actual product itself is quite comprehensive   best kit i ve purchased thus far  it comes with stickers for your bottle caps   great idea guys  was comparatively priced against competitors beers  a large bag of liquid malt  a smaller bag of dry malt  a can of pumpkin pie mix  debating tossing in another can on my own  brown sugar  a long vanilla bean stalk with a pouch of cinnamon  bittering hops  cheesecloth  priming sugar and dry yeast  wow  excellent care in their product for an absolutely appropriate price i cannot wait to brew this beer  and i absolutely anticipate doing a lot more business with jaspers my  rd homebrew ever and a step up from my other kit beers  it smelled so amazing brewing and fermenting  despite my rookie mistake by moving it to secondary fermentation after active fermentation was over it was a forgiving beer  carbonation was slow but at   weeks it s maturing into a tasty  wickedly good beer  mouth feel and foamy head throughout  yes i hear the snickers  but a fantastic beer  will be brewing my next batch soon and just tried another jasper s product shut the fck up amber   already in secondary fermentation   well played  boomchugalug i bought two of these kits to make ten gallons  after   weeks in the     gallon primary s i kegged   gallons  the instructions for the vodka  spices and vanilla bean slurry were vague as to when to make the potion and how to store it  i mixed mine on brew day and it sat in the fridge while the beer fermented  it turned into a snot ball  i sanitized a mason jar and took half the ten gallons worth of potion mixture and while i kegged i added some beer to the jar and shook it vigorously to break up the snot ball  it worked for the most part  the first   beers came out a bit chunky but it cleared up  the potion made the beer taste a bit like cider  it s got a very upfront pumkin spice kick with hints of cinnamon  i m not a big fan of these prominent flavors so i bottled the second   gallons without the potion overall the kits good  the abv came out at about   after adding an extra pound of dextrose i expect he bottles to be a bit more to my liking this is an extract kit  i don t recall seeing that anywhere in the description  good beer though this product always deliver quality and freshness as many other goya products  grew up drinking several brands but goya delivers the best one  deserve an excellent mark  but unfortunately the delivery process is slow at times and my last order still missing from my door front sweet and tasty great product  arrived with one broken  which made quite a big mess in the box i don t think this taste wonderful but i can chug it  it works great for women breastfeeding who want to increase their breast milk can t beat the price  very happy it s a good product always a classic  never disappoints  never had another sugar cane drink as good as this one  but then again  it is goya so you know it s good this beverage is really good for anyone who wants to remember puerto rico i m from pr and puertoricans love malta  it is really good that walmart bring our products these tortilla strips have a great flavor and pare well with salads and soups  i enjoy the added flavor to any type of salad  they are so good in a bowl of soup and remain crispy longer than you woukd expect i have had better strips  when i opened package found them slightly stale  sure enough check the expire date oct   well shoot  bought in oct  i should have known better  used them in soup and tossed the rest these tortilla chips are not only good  they are attractive and appealing looking on a salad perfect sipping tequila   chilled and neat  my buddy ordered some shots of this stuff during a horns game  frankly when it comes to tequila  i usually brace myself for a rough shot  maybe i m drinking the wrong stuff  because this was really easy to put back  no lingering aftertaste  reasonably priced  good value tequila if you re looking straight over ice i m a single malt scotch guy  i generally have two fingers neat with a quality cigar about once a week  on a stressful day  i ll have a couple of beers or so after work before the family gets home  the trouble is the beer gut that comes with that trend  i was looking for something similar to my favorite scotch  which is a

stores in my area  what happened the double oaked is ok  but no match for the black  where can i find it in sonoma county  california i bought this in early december and it didn t make it to the new year  this one is awesome  keep up the great work absolutely love  love  love it they don t state on the label how much ginger is in their ginger ale  i am to deduce that there isn t any  since they won t list it on the ingredients label i bought the   oz cans to keep in refrigerator for nausea  it workes miracles and what a perfect size love canada dry until about a month ago every carton i ve purchased has been flat no fizz and just bad tasting i ve used canada dry for years so certainly know good from bad  has there been a change cause they surely don t taste good good coffee  medium roast    with natural ingredients  ingredients  water coffee extract sugar milk powder soy lecithin  emulsifier this is the best mix to use for appletinis  taste great  i have tried others but nothing compares to rose  everyone always comments on the cool bottle  it is on the sweet side but that is why i like it  try it was looking everywhere for this product  and was starting to think that i would be out of luck  tried walmart com as a last resort  glad i did  thank you wal mart taste just like i thought it would   would buy again tasty this is great for moscow miles  it is very gingery and tastes much better than its higher priced competitor these franks are by far the best tasting franks we have had in a long time  love grilling them and having them just like at the ball park good size and taste for a get together foot ball game easy to preper saves you time and money great cuantity too good brand  has a good flavor and a cheaper price  been buying this brand for years  never had a complaint weiner s are very good  reasonable price i purchase these and separate and freeze them  i have  boys so they are always handy great for grilling and a great value this is a light  slightly bubbly tasting wine  not too sweet  not too bitter and dry are you not selling oak leaf wine in a box anymore we have been to   different wal marts without finding any  this in a box is great  please do not stop carrying it perfect sipping tequila   chilled and neat  my buddy ordered some shots of this stuff during a horns game  frankly when it comes to tequila  i usually brace myself for a rough shot  maybe i m drinking the wrong stuff  because this was really easy to put back  no lingering aftertaste  reasonably priced  good value tequila if you re looking straight over ice the white label or the devil s cut dashed with some lemonade and lime cordial is how i enjoy my jim best drink you can get to make manhattens best bourbon i have found have toured distillery and love the brand red stag and coke zero is my go to drink  only wish more bars and restaurants stocked it  nothing like a good bourbon with a cherry kick  i like it with dr peper to sip and relax better than the other s drank it for years and always smooth and tasty  now it is running off the shelves at our liquor store i keep jim beam on hand every day of the week i typically have this neat or with an ice cube  its light amber appearance  sweet  woody  mossy nose  and its mild moss  white oak  mellow wintergreen mint  and dried  faintly candied fruit flavor draws the drinker into an exploration of pin point distilling execution  jim beam original has a gradual finish  with a ghost of chocolate powder  during the fade out  highly recommended  rjt it s does have a great toaste to it the only drink i ll drink i had a neat   finger glass two weeks ago of jb black label for the first time  i ve always drank jack daniels  and i loved it  no more jack for me best tasteing and defenetly the smoothest around i love it i always keep a bottle of jim bean in my liquor cabinet  value for price is incredible and it mixes great if you love the taste of grapes this is your gonna love this great wine  a keeper in my cabin i m not a drinker and this taste delicious  i like it i use with blue agave light golden syrup an one lime over ice with gold sauza tequila perfect drink it s a bit sweet but blends up well my husband and his friend  who had never had a pia colada  thought this was awesome  perfect and easy to make for sitting around the pool on a very warm humid day great product pricing fast delivery  one great product  hard to find in the   ounce bottles  makes a great old fashion  note  use with splenda makes a very low calorie drink they barely have a hint of buffalo flavor  if you like your wings to taste of nothing but pepper than these are for you  they have plenty of flavor to them just not what your expecting for buffalo flavor  now the wings themselves are not bad  they are decently meaty  maybe a little to heavy on the breading  but not to bad though  the sizes of the wings vary greatly but not really a big deal  i d by them again if they change the flavoring  but i d say just stick to the plain and get your own sauce i did not have the same experience as the other reviewer  what we got was just as advertised   chunks of white meat in breading  my kids love these they had chicken  they were breaded  they didn t even need a dipping sauce the last time i bought buffalo wings  i bought a name brand  i was very disappointed with them as they had almost no heat at all  i bought the great value brand last time and i was apprehensive  but i could not believe how much flavor they had and how spicy they were  they were delicious quick  easy  and delicious i have to be honest for boneless chicken wyngz  these are definitely my favorite  i prefer them over the tyson brand  the only complaint i have is they are very hard to get in my local store  they are regularly out of them  that can be frustrating there delicious these great value buffalo style boneless wyngz are extremely hot  if you like spicy  hot  flavors in your food then these are for you  i thought they cooked up well  but i just did not care for the spicy hotness of them we usually buy the tyson any tizer boneless wings but bought these to save a little money  big mistake  these wings have twice the sodium as the tyson chicken and you can definitely tell by the taste  we ended up throwing the whole bag away  next time we ll spend the extra dollar tried these on a whim found much better than the usual name brand i buy we opened the bag and see nice sized chunks of chicken  we were mistaken  we see maybe   or   pieces of good sized chunks but the rest were tiny and mostly breading these pack some heay  good but spicy hot and irregular cuts of chicken not all of the walmarts around me have them so i always go to the one that carries them even though it s further away  yum yum yum these chicken wyngz were gross  way too much breading  and the taste of buffalo sauce was barely noticeable  at the price walmart sells these at  i can t recommend them on any level we go through a bag of these the first day i bring them home  they have the perfect amount of spicy  i do wish there were more in the bag was very dry the chicken did not have much flavor and tasted cheap the wings were nasty game and some wings  life is good they are good  just thought that it would be spicier my son loves them  great flavor and great price my son and grandson love these wings favor is better  meat is tender even in microwave   price is reasonable great price too my favorite very tender and juice  will buy again taste great tastes great       extremely hard to beat the price  but it seems to be very hard to find   in stock   one of the managers told me that a large display of it just sat all summer   i personally don t understand it   ever since i found it   i go out of my way to buy it  i personally like it more than some of the more expensive beers      for the price you can t beat this beer mild good taste enjoy perfect sipping tequila   chilled and neat  my buddy ordered some shots of this stuff during a horns game  frankly when it comes to tequila  i usually brace myself for a rough shot  maybe i m drinking the wrong stuff  because this was really easy to put back  no lingering aftertaste  reasonably priced  good value tequila if you re looking straight over ice excellent cucumber taste  makes the perfect summer cocktails expensive this really is the best root beer i have ever tasted  i usually buy it in our grocery store  about   per four pack  but it s sold out a lot  the ingredients are clean and natural  while most of the other root beers have junk ingredients  caramel color  i quit drinking traditional sodas years ago  because of the nasty ingredients and taste  virgil s is absolute heaven in a root beer float  virgil s root beer is micro

per case  from virgils rootbeer i have mixed feelings about virgil s rootbeer  to start with  the root and bark of the sassafras tree are no longer used  as they cause cancer and liver damage  the sarsaparilla vine used to be used  but nowadays  most root beers use an artificial sarsaparilla flavor  virgil s is naturally brewed from sweet birch  and a lot of other natural flavors  the licorice does not improve it  it contains too much sugar  and it is packaged in a breakable glass bottle  processed food makers in general use far too much sugar and salt than is good for us  virgil s rootbeer is natural and definitely different  but as a root beer  i can only give it three and a half amazon stars  rounded off to four stars  as amazon requires ratings to be in whole numbers the nutrition

it is the best tasting and healthy root beer ever  i am giving this as gifts to friends and family i only stumbled upon this after reading it s apparently created by walmart  it s a private label brand from what i read  not sure how true that is  but the taste was good all throughout  but i still have   or   left in the case to try  at a little less than a dollar per can  the price can t be beat  if you want to try something different lol need salt or a lime but the addition of it makes it even better drink very good flavor without a over powering finish  never need salt or a lime but the addition of it makes it even better one of my favorite silver tequilas use for shots this is hands down my favorite tequila  amazing taste at an amazing price  no lime salt needed i absolutely love this wine  with moscato d asti being my favorite  i have tried several brands  stella rosa is my absolute favorite  i won t try any others  it s crisp and sweet with no icky aftertaste  i love it very good sweet moscato tasted great twist off cap may easy to me if you put it down so it was knock down it would not spill out if you have cap on good a very good idea very good buy i understood some towards contributions go towards veterans  for those of you who want to enjoy a nice beverage that is not as sweet  try this mix  my husband has been purchasing this for some time now  added to that  we pay the   yearly one time purchase to have future items from walmart shipped to your home free  so worth the cost this product seems to help my liver if i take it before eating very happy to get more bitters in my diet  and they are organic this didn t taste like olive juice from an actual jar of olives  it tasted a bit sweeter or like it was synthetic  i wouldn t recommend i really like this product   it s the best out there  however  the combination of the occasional bad  mold  bottle  and the glass breakage leaking  for the price point it s not worth the hassle  if i can buy it locally i will  otherwise i have to give up on dirty sue  way better then using juice from the olives  best martinis i have made yet great addition to my martini monday      absolutely perfect  will reorder often really good stuff hubby says it s ok  but he prefers the olive juice in a jar of olives great for bloody mary s great stuff very satisfied it s a little too dirty but we used the whole bottle in a couple of weeks very tasty  just the mix i was looking for  good quality we have used other martini mixes  but this one is definitely the best  with a good vodka  the drinks are so smooth not bitter very  very good love this for my dirty martinis  the taste is very good great addition to dirty martinis above and beyond super good i like martinis about as dirty as they can come  this stuff is just the bomb  it s so much more flavorful than any olive juice i ve tasted from olives in a jar  it s full bodied  not just briny go ahead  you re definitely worth it have always loved dirty sue  arrives on time and works great in martini s it was everything i thought it would be and i would buy it again so far dirty sue martini mix is the best we have ever used   dirty sue is the best mix for dirty martini s that i have found a staple that we now can t live without makes the best dirty  tini s my go to for dirty martini s and it should be yours good dirty mix  a bit expensive so gave it   stars just the right mix to make my dirty martinis dirty i have tried every si gle kind of olive juice and have been extremely disappointed in all  even threw them out  in every case but dirty sue  this just can t be beat great  too bad it isn t available locally this is the stuff  delicious  i wanted to drink the bottle without the martini  i would definitely order thus again delicious  i recently went through a dirty martini phase and was frustrated with the inconsistent quality of my drinks  some were fabulous while others tasted outright disgusting  a waste of precious quality vodka  i quickly figured out that for me  only salt brines will do  no vinegar i was discarding a lot of expensive olives for the sake of a few drinks and thought surely there must be a source for brine only  i read reviews and ingredient lists until finding dirty sue  this product ain t cheap  it s salt water after all  but i was not disappointed  like i said before  no vinegar  i m very pleased  will be purchasing several bottles for christmas and pairing them with a nice vodka as gifts love it  but getting a little pricey  order     oz instead of a   pack of   oz  may be making slightly less dirty martinis dirty sue  the perfect companion for the perfect martini  will never cheat on her  highly recommend you give her a try  there s enough love to go around   if you want to make a good dirty martini  this is the stuff that is going to help you  it is the only olive juice my husband will take in his martinis and really the only one we ever have on hand always  because we do entertain a lot  this gets bought often and is enjoyed by all it makes the biggest difference  i tried to use brine as a substitute   horrible taste  it s the real deal  a true mixer  can t mix another dirty martini without it good stuff  one of the two best  the other being olive squeezins from fl  you can find on the market this product is great  i am a general manager at an upscale restaurant in hollywood  ca and i was tired of having my bartenders taking the time to drain the brine out of jars of olives  it s a huge waste of time  and the olives when separated from the brine dry out almost immediately  once i discovered dirty sue  not only did it fix these problems  but it allows me to offer my guests a much higher quality of olive juice  let s face it  if a patron is going to order a high end gin or vodka martini  why would they want a sub par ingredient mixed with it i cant even drink a dirty martini anymore if i dont have dirty sue  i use a shot of it in bloody mary s too  there is no comparison to the juice found in olive jars  this stuff is like the top shelf of olive brine  i highly recommend it if you like dirty martini s  this is the only way to go  the tasteis outta this world and it s a superior juice than the stuff thatcomes in olive jars to preserve the olives  ask for it at your local bar this is just what i have been looking for as a lover of a good strong dirty martini i am known for having a refer full of juiceless olive jars  dirty sue was truly a find  i keep plenty of it stocked enough to share with my fiends and even those mere acquaintances that stop by taste s great  no sugar free after taste  i mix with soda water excellent product very easy to use very useful when it comes to the holidays i highly recommend it if you are not skilled in the preparation of cocktails i liked all of the favors  i was pleasantly surprised that these didn t have that no calorie drink aftertaste  the alcohol of course adds calories but you save about   using these instead of the ones with calories  the strawberry lemonade was the best  i used cheaper tequila  jose cuervo  which was just fine i like the modern cocktail packs  but was a little misled by the description for this one on amazon possibly not the manufacturer s fault   their package description is spot on on amazon it says something like  add gin or vodka for martinis and other similar drinks but this one is all formulated for tequila   all the drinks are margaritas or other tequila drinks instead of the sugar that comes with the other drinks  this one comes with salt i am not saying it s bad   for   calories  obviously they couldn t use sugar  but i just assumed they would be just like the other mixes but made with nutrisweet or something as long as you know what to expect   a much less sweet drink that goes better with tequila salt   then they are fine  of course  you can put whatever liquor you want in there  but i tried one with vodka and it just tasted odd to me here is exactly what the drinks are  mango skinny margarita  blood orange tequila sunrise  classic skinny margarita  strawberry tequila lemonade  acai blueberry skinny margarita this is a good product to acquire via commerce if you are desperate for a liquid to possess  it can be placed in a container  swallowing it is possible  it can go in your mouth region  alcohol is intended to go into it  and i personally recommend that you dilute these liquids with booze flavors  the boozeahol can help to momentarily distract you from the uncomfortable truth that the acai blueberry fluid tastes like you hijacked the smurfs  winnebago and put its tire in your mouth  all in all  these liquids do not contain dangerous solids which may choke you  so they successfully could be considered fluid  drink them  or else this drink is good im not a heavy drinker but a friend shared this drink with me and its light with a kick weekend to relax at home this review was collected as part of a promotion best margarita for summer with friends i was so glad that this product was available on line and the delivery so quick as i was able to take this mixer with me to share at a cottage  thank you  i will continue to purchase items on line  grab and go is super convenient great for entertaining  i always have this on hand in my freezer  makes an impressive drink by the pool i m a bartender  this stuff is good  try it  you will not regret it everything went as planed  no surprises  thank you had a pool party  the margaritas were a real hit cobblestone bread co  original english muffins are wonderful for breakfast sandwiches  toasted and spread with butter and drizzled with honey or jam  what can i say not enough for sure  you have to try them  maybe for lunch with chicken salad or a blt when tomatoes are ripe and juicy  any way  they are the best i like these better than thomas english muffins  the texture and pre slitting is better cobblestone english muffins  wheat   ct  are they  spose to be so doughy hard to slice  cuz the doughy inside balls up  taste very good   only after toasting till the edges burn these english muffins are very good and they are half the price of others i love the cobblestone original english muffins  being from new england  these are the type of english muffins i am used to  i don t like those other ones with the nooks and crannies  in new england  you can find this type in every grocery store  not necessarily the cobblestone brand  it s hard to find this type in the south  seems like they only sell thomas s which are gross  sometimes i can find these at food lion but my walmart doesn t even have a spot on the shelf this product is as good as if not better  stays fresher longer and their other products are very good as well bought these just to try them out  they were great  flavorful  crispy when lightly toasted  we will definitely buy them again first time trying these  really good great much better than the name brand doesn t have nooks and crannies but for the price i really enjoy them not soft like orowheat dry enough but not overpowering this chardonnay pairs great with all types of meals and also seems to appease all wine drinkers  good choice for large gatherings  great value and guests are happy with the quality this is my favorite brand and size i drink it instead of v  for breakfast  along with an occasional true bloody mary when i am entertaining friends  my only complaint is the delivery packaging of a pack of     the box was delivered upside down and was ripped   the contents  thankfully  were not damaged  it would help if the outer box was labeled this side up  i love this product and drink usually an   oz bottle daily with nothing in it but the mix  it is like snappy tom but i like it better  the last time i ordered a case of it and it is almost gone already  if you like a spicy tomato drink i highly recommend it i love this and drink it without alcohol every day  but  it is practically non existent in the stores  you can find bold spicy but not this  and why does this cost almost   more per bottle then the bold spicy hi  this is cocktail artist robert porter  first  i d like to thank you for taking the time to review my cocktail artist premium manhattan mix  i am totally humbled and very passionate about bringing you this remarkable product  what i ve done is take out the guess work for making an exceptional manhattan at home  just use   parts whiskey and   part ca manhattan mix  stir with ice and enjoy yes it s that easy  by being able to create a unique product that is made with all natural ingredients and pure cane sugar you get a smooth  well balanced cocktail that doesn t have any artificial flavors or aftertaste  try my manhattan mix with other cocktail artist

julip  if your not a big fan whiskey  you can use this with other spirits  mix tequila with ca manhattan mix and our premium lime juice for a fine margarita  or make a dark and stormy using lite rum  ca manhattan mix  ca mule mix and top with club soda  another favorite of mine is the nigroni with gin  ca manhattan mix  campari and an orange twist  i urge you guys to exparament and see what you can create  make the glass your canvas  mix it like you mean it  robert omg love  love the best cocktail mix ever  a must try for everyone  don t miss out although i don t feel it s necessary to describe how angels came down from heaven to squeeze tiny droplets of nirvana into a bottle to be sold across the country in retailers under this brand and recipe  i feel i will be expressing this to everyone i meet until the bitter end of my life  this mix  this powerful concoction of pure ecstasy   is unbelievably awesome and will likely turn me into a raging alcoholic passed out in a gutter occasionally coming to the surface to scream i need more as monkeys and degenerate courtesans frolic in my bodily fluids streaming from both ends  it s that freaking good folks  buy it  buy cases of it  snort it  drink it  shoot it  whatever you do   just try it  once you do you ll be on here leaving another depraved review  hopefully three times more twisted than mine  god speed  god speed after finding out that i was hosting an impromptu b day party for a friend i scrambled knowing that my beverage knowledge was very basic  limited to essentially beer  wine and liquor soda  further  i knew that i would soon host several liquor pros  including those that would size up my novice bartending abilities  enter the cocktail artist essential bar ingredients premium manhattan mix  making my pre shindig trip to walmart  i circled the aisles looking for something that could help me out  i came across a bottle of this liquid magic which allowed me to craft top notch manhattans  to this day  i still am asked by party patrons what was my secret recipe  go figure  if you need instant bartender credibility for your next soire  look no further than this life saver bought this on a whim last minute for a dinner party and was very pleasantly surprised    tried it with both bourbon  bulleit  and rye  rittenhouse  and both came out great  it has a nice citrusyness that brings all the flavors together quite nicely and it wasn t too sweet or syrupy or artificial tasting at all  loved this product and will definitely be making it a staple in my home bar can t wait to sample the other products in their line as well the best easiest manhatten ever  was such a great mix to have for our diy cocktail party  now it s always in our bar at home  sometimes you just need a fancy drink best cocktail product ever  my husband is a  yr career bartender this changed his game  it is now the staple of his bar  it s so smooth light  makes it impossible to have just  i m very impressed with the fact that this mannhattan mix represented by robert porter  has natural ingredients  and is not laden with fake chemicals  i prefer my drinks to taste real  fresh and balanced  and this mix is a lovely complement to my whiskey of choice  i highly recommend this mix this is amazing  i was shocked by how smooth  and tasty it was  usually i do not buy cocktail mixes but a friend recommended this one to me  and i am so glad she did  i love it  it will defiantly be a staple in my home and parties i have to say i never thought of buying a mix like this  but it is so tasty and delicious  all you have to do is add your favorite whiskey and some robert porter over ice  super easy manhattan and very smooth  and tastes amazing  highly recommended i wasn t too sure about this at first because it was so inexpensive but thought i d give it a shot  it far exceeded all expectations  so delicious and smooth  super impressed  plus it doesn t hurt that the guy on the bottle is cute just sayin this is a superb drink for those days you don t feel like getting dressed for that upscale bar downtown  invite a friend and share this cocktail at home  this is an elegant drink for those with a sophisticated palate  this cocktail will now be a staple in my home bar not personally into pre made mixes  but bought this for entertaining friends the other night  was extremely impressed  so smooth and balanced  everyone loved their manhattans  all you have to do is add your whiskey or bourbon of choice  there are no artificial flavors or high fructose corn syrups in the mix either  just pure cane sugar  honestly probably safer than using the liqueurs on the market  as a bartender myself i m telling you to get this product i used this manhattan mixer at our weekend pool party and it was an absolute hit  cocktails were delicious and simple to make  it was one of the conversational pieces of the party this is great stuff  i wasn t sure what to expect before trying it  because it s the first time i ve tried manhattan mix  it is so easy to make and even easier to drink  delicious  smooth  wonderful on the palette  next time i m in i m going to buy   of them  and also get some for my friends  great stuff  please keep this in stock love this  great product  prefect for parties  graduation  summer bbq s it s a full bodied and delicious  i use it at get together or just when i m needing that manhattan at home after work i am a fan of the manhattan  although rarely do i buy a mix  however i decided to give this a try  the price couldn t be beat  smooth taste  authentic to a true manhattan  just follow the directions on the bottle  simple as that  it s a great tasting mixer  in a good size bottle at a good price this was the best buy the manhattan was perfect   tasty  and smooth  i was at a party and first tried the drink and went out and purchased for my party coming up  i had to share i think people will love love it great tasting fool proof mix served in a very stylish bottle this is so delicious  you can actually make a perfect tasting  smooth manhattan like a pro  great product had this for a party last night it was a hit  fantastic mix  whoever put this together knows their stuff  highly recommended what an amazing product  absolutely love it this product is so simple and easy to use   i ve tried different manhatan mixes before and this one is by far my favorite  it meshes very well w any burbon and the flavors don t overpower and try to mask the burbon like other products   it s an essential to my mini bar at home  amazing product i have a manhattan almost everyday after work  my wife bought me this to try and although it is decent  it is not necessary  spend your money on quality vermouth and of course the best bourbon one can afford i ve already went through   bottles of this stuff  great tasting and smooth  and so easy to make my favorite drink  a manhattan  definitely recommend this as a premium mixer a must for every home bar  how easy can it get amazing product  it make making a cocktail easy and tastes great so good  it really makes having a craft cocktail at home really easy  it is so hard to find natural products these days  especially mixers  i really love this one  the taste is excellent  i m going to try some of the other mixers now too  this one is definitely my new favorite mixer i love this mix  it s easy and taste delicious after tasting the smooth flavor of this mix  i discovered a more natural way to enjoy a manhattan this mix was the star of the party  we could not make it fast enough for the guest to drink although this is a manhattan mix  i love to add it to many of my cocktails  the flavors are so complex  they elevate the flavor profile of my concoctions it was a little tart but i like that what a great mix  makes an excellent margarita  just add tequila very small amount for the price  won t make this mistake again this is the bomb sweet then hits you like fire good spice and a cool label on the bottle very poor packaging  wrapping and shipping  two of three bottles were broke on arrival  if you love grape juice with a twist  this is a must try everything is great about this product  cheap price  perfect taste  mixing this flavor with just a soda makes it delicious i m a single malt scotch guy  i generally have two fingers neat with a quality cigar about once a week  on a stressful day  i ll have a couple of beers or so after work before the family gets home  the trouble is the beer gut that comes with that trend  i was looking for something similar to my favorite scotch  which is a little out of my budget to drink daily  jim beam black is an awesome substitute with the rich white oak aroma and flavor  it isn t near as smooth as my favorite scotch  but the flavor is on point  thank you jim beam for putting this great whiskey out there at an affordable price  you ve got a customer for life exceptionally good flavor no matter where i go after years of various bourbon tastings jim beam black is head and shoulders above the rest no matter what the price tag i m personally a wild turkey drinker  but cudos to jim beam for producing such a classy commercial  got the right girl to be their spokesperson  good job  very classy seriously you ask what s great about it what isn t great about it no explanation necessary i first started drinking jim bean when i went camping  i didnt want to carry the bear around so i tried jim bean  my first was red stag cherry  than i tried devils cut when i came home  i have been hooked ever since  i usually mix with coke or dr pepper this is the best bourbon under   you can buy  one of the smoothest bourbons i ve tasted  i typically drink woodford reserve or eagle rare until i tried this  i buy a bottle every two weeks now this is beam at it s best very smooth i tried jb black for the first time tonight  it is so smooth  we made whiskey sours with it and they were awesome  thanks jim beam for this awesome bourbon i have been enjoying jb black for the past three years  the has all the flavor os a higher proof  bur   i can have another without collapsing  now it has disappeared from even the most extensive liquor stores in my area  what happened the double oaked is ok  but no match for the black  where can i find it in sonoma county  california i bought this in early december and it didn t make it to the new year  this one is awesome  keep up the great work absolutely love  love  love it i really like how compact and easy to use this pressure washer is  would buy it again in an instant after using it first off its not as powerful as the gas model i had but its not as bad as the other reviews describe  my gas model would peel paint  this one is not that strong  if you need something to wash and clean  it works fine on concrete and dirt  if you need to peel paint  get a gas one i was lucky to purchase this power washer on sale for     my patio and porch look like new  my drive way and sidewalks look new as well  i decided to power wash my house too  all with just water  everything done in about   hours  easy to use  great investment great review  barbecue pits are next i used this a lot to clean my wheel wells on my truck of road pack and the underside of my riding mower  i was disappointed to see that after only   years of use my pump developed a leak which would cost more to fix than than buying a new unit  i am retired and can t afford to buy one every   years but it looks like i will if you re going to take the time a pressure wash your driveway or your house  this is not worth the time or effort  the nozzle is so small and the actual dirt that comes off is the same amount from a normal hose i also got this during sam s spring sale  having messed with my father s   year old electric pressure washer  i didn t have high hopes  i was looking for something inexpensive that would clean my driveway  grill and fence every so often  yes  gas models are more powerful  but they re more expensive and you need to maintain them  first off   the build quality  seems rugged  metal couplings for hoses  vs plastic for my dad s old one  how well it does  concrete was cleaned  the big circle washer does an ok job  but the turbo washer really gets it done  see photo  the big circle washer would be good for maintaining  not for a deep clean  also had no issues cleaning my grill from   years of grease  overall with a   year warranty i m pretty happy with this bought  assembled  and used it to clean concrete with mold  mildew  and moss on it  worked great i got this to do a power washing job  and i love it  it s small yet powerful comes with a variety of different accessories that you would end up paying more money for sam s club is   percent pleasing with its all of its sales products  everything from electrical  electronic  groceries  furniture  building products  recreational and mechanical etc  my black max pressure washer gets five stars and the sales price was the best  i recommended that my youngest son purchase one and he loves it too  thanks  sams club great electric pressure washer  the scrubber worked great on my patio i purchased an electric model just to avoid another gas engine  this model works good cleaning our patio aggregate steps  walk driveway  it s light weight  easy to store priced accordingly i m a woman who doesn t like to wait for her husband to help her do something  i can operate this by myself  i was surprised at how nicely it cleaned our composite decking  our   year oldcement steps had green moss and black stains and i was able to clean they also  i used scott s outdoor soap and can easily attach different nozzles and attachments  i hated our our gas power washer and we had much trouble with it  i hope this one lasts as it is a good value i bought this article on sale and was a good deal it doesn t has a lot of power but works i did purchase this pressure washer about a month ago and just used it  i am very happy with it  i got a lot of bang for my buck  i really like it for its size works good  have two gas ones but can t use inside due to fumes  this electric one does the job great price works great does what i need it to do  great attachments  not as powerful as gas powered but knew that before purchase nice machine   it s slower than a gas machine but it gets the job done i have used the black max pressure washer countless times since it arrived  i was able to clean green moss type mold from between the clay bricks in my courtyard that has been there for years  this piece of equipment is very easy to handle  even for a small person such as myself  i love my pressure washer had a gas pressure washer  worked well for a couple of years  with some minor repairs  then finally went kaput  only need it for light cleaning  this one started without problem  and did the job it was intended for  and it was reasonably priced bought last year and used once  not strong enough to do much more than wash your car  sprayer is plastic and not rugged  sprayer ailed on me this year  internal components rusted even though the washer was drained  threaded connection to the sprayer is plastic  cheaply made  now junkyard schweppes makes a good diet tonic  i prefer canada dry only because it seems to hold the fizz longer  i don t drink generic  i have not found any of the off brands that taste good compared to schweppes and canada dry  please don t stop carrying or even add canada dry  the only other thing i suggest is to stock more on the shelves as most of the time there is maybe one or two on the shelf  sartell walmart if you drink tonic water  this one is the best tasting and it is great that walmart now has it available and will ship it to your home  i hope they continue this the product advertise said  pk  i have no idea what that means but i assumed it was going to be   pack   it turned out to be one bottle for     less expensive to buy at the store  it does not make any sense great taste i have been trying to cut back on sugar and found this has the best taste   i compared canada dry polar walmart   but i can t find in smaller bottle or cans great product and will purchase again schweppes tonic is the best there is because it doesn t lose it s fizz and always has a great refreshing taste it was just ok  i will buy it only if you guys run out of your great value diet tonic water   because i have to have the diet  schweppes just doesn t have the flavor nor does it it hold its carbonation like the great value brand does this is a rich and delicious red wineblend that many will enjoy  its full of dark fruit flavors and zinfindel  the best red blend that i have ever had it s delish  the only suggestion i have is to sell a bigger bottle with a handle i love everything about jim beam apple  the taste is great and it goes down smooth  it s one of the best drinks out there with or without any added mixes i was hesitant to buy jim beam apple  after trying other apple whiskeys  but i was not disappointed  it s so smooth  light and fruity  very good very smooth  but very sweet  i would like to know how much sugar is added i mix the jim beam apple with a little ginger ale  it is a great summer refreshment it makes the greatest apple bourbon martini outstanding  smooth  easy to drink the apple jim beam is the bomb it s smooth no chaser needed i am hooked this is a great tasting refreshing drink just as good as any good bar bloody mary if you are trying to save calories and still have a tasty margarita this mix is great  use a few drops of essential lime oil to give a more natural taste though my wife loves margaritas  and  i have always struggled with how to make the perfect margarita  but  along comes jose cuervo classic lime light margarita mix and l feel like a pro  with zero calories zero carbs and zero sugars  the only calories  sugars  are from the alcohol  this mix is the best  here s my formula      parts mix     part tequila  i love logado from total wine      to   teaspoons of artificial sweetner   a big splash of gran gala liquer  the drink should become a light amber color      fresh lime juice mix well and add crushed ice  voila taste great  but never enough in stock at the stores i have been buying this for years  tastes like homemade without calories  not as sweet as other mixes love the taste  very good good refreshing drink and taste great with taco dip  a true summer treat tastes great this is a great product to beat the gain weight vs  no cold margaritas in the summer battle   good flavor and no calories  i usually squeeze a lime into the pitcher and they taste great  low price great taste tastes great it s a good tasting low cal mixer  you do not have to buy expensive tequila for it to taste good i didn t like this product when compared to master of mixes lite  jose cuervo seemed flat with little or no tartness  and tasted artificial  don t believe it contains any real lime juice if the mouth of the bottle was bigger it would make it easier to get the product out after putting in the freezer  i m sure other people do this making large batches  once the tequila is mixed in  the mix melts quickly so placing in the freezer would speed up the process if you could then get it out  why only   stars since i started using this product cant hardly drink a margarita made with high calorie mixers  fortunately more folks in my walmart area are also starting to use and now our local walmart rarely doesn t have it i cannot find this in the stores  so glad jet has it  this review was collected as part of a promotion my husband and i love the unique taste of this margarita mix  jet was the only place that offered this mix at a grate price  the delivery was fast  we will continue to order from jet  this review was collected as part of a promotion add tequila or just seltzer and a slice of fresh lime to make a virgin margarita  it s great both ways  perfect for summer entertaining  sweepstakes this review was collected as part of a promotion by far the best mixer i have had the pleasure of tasting  perfectly balanced sweet  tart  and citrus notes  it was so popular at a gathering that it didn t last past   minutes excellent taste  no high fructose corn syrup im a very picky margarita drinker  i always make my own lime juice mix  but i decided to give this a try  and to tell you the truth  the margaritas were awesome  not too sweet not to tart taste really good  i would buy again to make large batches some of the best tasting margarita mix i have used  highly recommend this is the best margarita mix   not too sweet  everytime i host a party i serve this and people love my margaritas bought this for my parents  they said it was awful and tasted very chemical  they love margaritas  so i bought this after reading reviews  won t do that again we bought our first bottle of powell mahoney margarita mix locally and decided it was the very best mix we ever had  hard to find in local shops  glad we found it on amazon  all natural ingredients and hand crafted this is an excellent pre made mixer  without artificial taste  however  it is available in my grocery store for about half this price tastes pretty good but you pay for it  too lazy to make my own mix fresh this margarita mix tastes soooo good   it s not too sweet unlike other brands  you don t need to add anything  just your tequila of choice and you re good to go one of the best but it takes to long to get great natural margarita mix great margarita mix ad service very good mix great margarita don t waste your money  over rated  over priced  you could make your own by looking up an online recipe and wouldn t be able to tell the difference do you love margaritas they are among the most popular adult beverages in america and many people rank them as their favorite alcoholic beverage of all  the right tequila can make a noticeable difference when mixing up a margarita  but the right mixer is important as well  and one of the best mixers available is power mahoney margarita i just got to know powell mahoney recently and i have been singing its praises ever since  this mix is every bit as delicious as the others in the powell mahoney lineup thanks in no small part to the all  natural ingredients used in the process  have you taken a good look at the ingredients used in other mixers they re enough to make even the most tolerant person cringe  even a really good tequila often cannot mask the taste of a bad mixer and i can think of many mixed drinks that i could barely finish due to a less than pleasant mixer base with powell mahnoey margarita mixer  you get the great  natural taste you desire with a good balance between the sweet and the sour  pour a little into a glass and taste it all by itself  you will notice flavors of lime and a little bit of orange with an overall taste that leans toward the sour side but one that seems just right to match with a fine tequila  the taste is even good enough that some people might enjoy this mixer served with non  alcoholic combinations like soda water and even on the rocks with nothing added margaritas are popular drinks but even your favorite drink can lose its appeal if it contains a weak ingredient  with powell mahoney margarita mixer  you get the great  natural  fresh citrus flavor that makes for the perfect mixed drink  buy a bottle from this vermont  based company and fall in love with your margarita  all over again excellent flavor  not at all sweet syrupy like other mixes yum  over shaved ice with a lime wedge  it arrived so quickly to boot fantastic  from the  s to the  st century  try it in the drinks and mixtures  it works  this is tge best bittera for tiki drinks you can get  it gives them that extra bust yoy need to make it over the top to the people who don t think things like bitters and muddled fruit don t make any difference in a drink  they couldn t be more wrong  this habenero shrub bitter adds a real dimension to the cocktail and anyone serious about their drink should have this love this product we ve been using it almost nightly to make cocktails love these bitters  a small drop in bourbon or vodka really transforms the spirit the perfect accompaniment to any bourbon drink this stuff rocks  use it for one of the employees only bar cocktail recipes awesome and prompt shipping great selection of different flavors for a starter set the perfect touch  with a good punch of heat a wonderful flavor filled bitters  it appears to be made for beach drinks with rum  but i love using it in my manhattans  i ve also added it to apples sauteed in butter and brown sugar  yum great flavor and perfect for my winter drinks yummy  in my gin drinks or just with seltzer these were bomb diggity perfect for my use i bought the bittermen s hopped grapefruit bitters for my sister and brother in law as a christmas gift  i haven t tried the product myself  but they have been raving about how nicely the bitters enhance a gin and tonic or a reposado cocktail used them to make just a few of these fine cocktails margie has some spice the mezcal fizz and the mexican firing squad and they were perfect purchased as a gift and recipient loved it for his old fashions bittermens bitters are the bomb  every home bar needs a few of these on hand this is extremely spicy with ginger  not so much gingerbread flavor  as i hoped for i m thinking of blending it with other bitters to achieve more of a gingerbread flavor the mole bitters are delicious delicious bitters  really completes my oaxacan old fashioneds  wish it came in a smaller quantity for a more affordable price  it ll be years before i have to buy another one of these i love spicy foods  and this provides a great twist on an old fashioned  love it great product some of my favorite bitters ever  great unique flavor  now if they just weren t so darn expensive we ordered this to add to a collection of bitters for making old fashions  i was afraid it might be too spicy but it created a lovely addition with a hint of chocolate and spice great for jazzy up my tiki cocktails great for gin drinks great to make spicy drinks delicious  deep flavor that is unlike any bitters i ve tried love this  perfect to add a little heat to your cocktail must use a lot as it wasn t that strong excellent ingredient to make a bayshore sunrise cocktail this stuff is magic if you love spicy shrubby  makes my manhattans sooo good with a high quality vermouth amazing   thank you did not like the flavor of these pleased with purchase i love it with iced coffee  cream  and honey fantastic stuff great supplement to cocktails delicious    squirts from the eye dropper in   liter of sparking water for a great orange water cheaper than buying cans if you use a soda maker these are delicious  they will take any fruity tropical drink to the next dimension with a subtle spiced layer  cuts the sweetness and adds depth these sounded better than they ended up being  i found them to be a little too bitter and tart for an old fashioned  now i love cranberries  and understand how tart real ones are but in a drink i do not really want to be a purist  i want great taste  i will try adding a bit more sugar to my drink  but i doubt it will make mush of an impact  bottom line is  ok  but not great great for negroni i like to add a few drops of this to my scotch on those occasions when i cant afford my favorite islay single malt tiki bitters makes an for an excellent sharpie mustache and i will experiment more with them for other tropical coctails as well  the packaging is nice i like the dropper  is only reason for   stars i had this in a cocktail i had in a restaurant  good purchase  i haven t tried it in anything else yet delicious and hard to get more than a whisper out at one time good for cocktails great bitters  love all their products a very well received gift i have several of their bitters now and use them both when the occasion presents itself  i really like a few drops of the xocolati bitters in a good negroni  it adds a whole new layer of complexity  i am looking forward to trying the elemakule tiki bitters  since i ve just gotten interested in making tiki drinks i also really like their hopped grapefruit bitters  really nice in a good gt great for bloody mary s wow  what a great addition for anyone who makes tiki drinks  goes perfectly not only with rum  but tangueray  throw out the skunk flavored angostura bitters  this is the perfect compliment to most tiki drinks and especially anything you make with don s mix  thank you bittermens  now you need to get this stuff on the store shelves delicious addition to rye and water oh my gosh  this is so delicious  i ve only used it so far in cocktails but have received so many compliments on it  friends have asked what s in this drink  it s so delicious  i actually bought a few other flavors to give as a gift we make a burlesque martini with fresh rosemary with this at our bar  it s very tasty this is my favorite bartender s favorite bitters   nough said something for every bar man home or professional  essential mixology  and the fusion of alcohol with fine cuisine the best does not taste like habaneros what so ever  very disappointing  not to mention you have to pour half the bottle in your tiny drink to taste it the  burlesque  has a distinctive central flavor   i think it s walnut husk  aromatic and bitter in itself  and easy to pair with warm flavors  i like that taste  having done some experiments based on the parsons book  and find it uncommon among the commercial bitters i ve tried but  i have to say  i still prefer my own walnut based flavors  this comes on strong with the central flavor and enticing bitterness  but lacks the secondary and tertiary notes that make a flavor memorable  so  it s good  if i didn t make my own  very good   it would be a regular on my shelf  recommended  unless you make your own  wiredweirdps  i m not a fan of dropper bottles  and this comes with a medicine dropper  perhaps you get more repeatability and precision with a dropper  until the bottle runs low  but i prefer the convenience of a shaker  which you can find easily at amazon enhanced our beverage perfectly a fun bitter to experiment with your drinks  tastes great this product is fantastic  and i haven t yet found anything that can really take its place  when i got it  i took out the dropper and dripped a little right on my tongue and instantly fell in love  it has the depth and complexity of flavor you expect from bitters  but it s not overwhelming  i love a glass of rum with just a couple dashes of this in it  or in an east india trading co  cocktail  with rum  sherry and amaro liqueur  i highly recommend add as a wonderful surprise to bloody mary s or over pepper vodka on the rocks  try on steak or chicken on the grill only used these bitters twice but each time they ve been outstanding  definitely necessary if you find a drink you want to make with them  nothing else would replace them this is specifically for the xocolatl mole bitters as amazon seems to have lumped all the reviews together  tasted in person at a bitters bar at oxbow market in napa and was excited to find easily on amazon  a few drops in any tequila drink makes me happy   just a subtle hint of chocolate and heat  as i often use bitter sour mixers less is more  or else it pushes the drink way too bitter  will definitely buy again if i ever finish the bottle i have   a little goes a long way is ok need more intense on flavor what great bitters  with a bit of searching  one can find a host of creative cocktails to use the bitters for  highly recommended the mole flavor is so rich and lingering  it is balanced perfectly with its bitter quality  i cannot imagine drinking a tiki  slide  cocoa  or a runner without a splash of this in it  amazing great for a mole margarita like tommy bahamas makes only knock is for the actual taste which is not quite orange cream but a vanilla vinegar orange rhine sort of taste  depends on what you re going for in taste profile as i can see this easily matching some others  preferences for mixed drinks these bitters taste great and last a long time  a perfect addition to a manhattan or old fashioned  product arrived in perfect condition and on time dump the plastic dropper rod attached to the cap immediately on receipt it pulls right off  whether or not you like the taste of the product  i was pleased enough  the  inch plastic dropper rod  while very handy for adding drops of the bitters to one s drink in a measured manner  is made from an extremely foul source discovered this after having finished off a bottle of bittermen s grapefruit bitters and leaving it on the shelf for a month  then opened up the bottle to add some gin and absorb the remains of the bitters to the quite empty bottle  an extremely foul toxic smell emerged immediately investigating  i found it to unmistakably be the plastic dropper rod attached to the bottle cap  while immersed in the strong smelling and  tasting bitters solution  it s disguised  when not  well    it is just revolting  try it see for yourself no one should be ingesting any substance steeped in this material  bittermen s  you really gotta clean up your act with that dropper rod just a friendly reminder  shrub bitters are bitters that contain lots of vinegar  if the thought of drinking a bottle of vinegar sounds appealing to you  then you may enjoy this  if it doesn t  then you do not want these   take a whiff and it smells like someone dying easter eggs   if you want a spicy bitter that s not a shrub  try scrappy s habanero firewater bitters instead delicious bitters  great addition to any cocktail great they smell fantastic  i haven t tried them myself yet  but they smell like heaven and i ve been informed they taste good  too  bottle is sturdy and doesn t leak  dropper works well and doesn t drip much  so it s easy to transfer to drink cleanly tasty stuff  hop and grapefruit flavors are nicely balance  good for cocktails that would benefit from some sharp  high flavor notes i ve tried this in a few drinks so far and none have turned out tasting any good i wrote to the company and asked if they had any suggestions for using it but they never responded probably will just sit on the shelf now until i get tired of seeing it and toss it i ve had this for about   weeks now and i can t seem to find too many uses for it  great in gin martini type drinks and mellows out some harsher spirits in cocktails  otherwise i can t really find too many recipes online or uses for it  shipping and packaging is excellent i bought this for one specific purpose   as an ingredient for a cocktail called carter beats the devil       and  it works great  it s not quite as prominent of an ingredient as the chili tincture that the restaurant in san francisco used  but it does the job   just wish it had more punch per drop i ve used it quite a bit   and  since it is measured in drops  it ll probably last me forever i am interested now in trying more of bittermens bitters       glad i bought this one i love all sorts of bitters  but this one is a favorite of mine  it has a complex flavor with hints of cardamom and clove and also exotic fruits  i like it in grapefruit  gin and sodas  and also in jack and cokes  makes a great manhattan bittermens xocolatl mole bitters add a complex note to manhattans other cocktails  very full flavored  rich undertone  we love it perfect for the carter beats the devil cocktail  an invention of flora in oakland    drops go a very long way the tear dropper is a bit confusing your first time  but these are simply delicious  the aroma hits you right off the bat when you open the bottle  the aromatic hops go wonderfully with grapefruit  and these bitters are awesome in a sawyer  mojito  or daiquiri  it is a strange combination  but it really works  try these my husband is a tequila officianado and was delighted to find these bitters on amazon com he immediately ordered them and enjoys a drop in his tequila on the rocks every evening great product good bitters with rye whiskey and punt e mes vermouth  drink responsibly  as a matter of fact do everything responsibly fantastic  came quickly  love love love  makes great cocktails  would recommend to anyone  thank you so much bitter mans  you are great on the advice of a highly knowledgeable relative  i bought this as a stocking stuffer for another family member  it was a big hit  and i must say  very interesting addition to a cocktail  now i need some thanks it s ok i love these bitters  you get what you pay for  and while this product is pricey it is also delicious if you miss dr  brown s cel ray soda  use this to make your own interesting addition to latin based cocktails  saves me preparing the shrub it myself thanks great signature flavors and aromas beautifully aromatic  this is great for adding subtle hints of citrus and vanilla to any cocktail or dessert interesting flavor to add to summer refreshments  not too spicy it is just perfect  experiment to fit your taste i love chocolate bitters in a manhattan  the full flavor of these bitters balances nicely with the richness of carpano antica not everything does and you need a rye with some kick to bring it all together this stuff has just the right amount of heat   enough to be worth using  but not so much that you can make your cocktails undrinkable without effort  i put it in any cocktail that needs a little bite  and have been happy with the results not wanting alcohol on an outing with colleagues but wanting something that has taste  i ordered club soda with bitters  it was a well sorted bar  and the bar tender gave me the choice  loving anything spicy  i tried the hellfire and it was so wonderful that i had to order a bottle to greet me when i get home two drops in a gin vermouth martini is just about perfect  good stuff  luckily  it comes with a dropper i ve put it in my manhattans and martinis  super delicious  i can t wait to try it in other drinks  i ve used   drops per drink for a little kick on the back end this doesnt put out the heat i wanted  to get a good bite you add so much it effects the flavor of the drink it s not terrible  but a chopped jalapeo can get just as much if not more heat   with a better flavor while bittermens primarily makes various kinds of bitters for making drinks   this one is not technically bitters  but a tart shrub   especially good for adding to bloody marys  and an amazing bloody shrimp martini  i m sure you could make a good drink in the traditional shrub recipes   but a dropper of this really brightens up even the most plain jane bloody recipe with a shot of liquid celery flavor  love it these are an interesting addition to a bitters collection  excellent in rum drinks  very pleased and would definitely recommend if you mix up cocktails which i make  and enjoy  and i am totally not an alcoholic just because i have an adult beverage once or twice a week  with some bitters in it mixology has become a passion of mine i m known in my friend circle for making gfc s  good f n cocktails  bittermens hellfire is one of my secret ingredients  it adds just the right subtle heat to anything i make i ve carefully selected over a dozen really top notch hand crafted bitters to add just the right extra something to my cocktails  these folks have created one of the very best bitters out there   thank you adds great flavor to any beverage  i suggest trying it with vodka or gin  looking forward to using it in a drink with dark liqueur so the habanero bitters are great in a version of a margarita we do that traditionally used tabasco  i like this at least as much and you don t get any of the vinegar flavor one does from tabasco also  love the tiki bitters and a bitter monk is my new favorite cocktail just because i get to use this in it great stuff these bitters are great and the dropper bottle is an easy way to use th estuff in all kinds of cocktails  my only complaint was that the boston bitahs leaked in transit  so the entire box smelled  great  and i only have about   of the bottle remaining  still  that was one bottle out of an order of   so i m not complaining i use these in all kinds of tiki drinks and they are really great   they have lots of warm spice notes and lend an exotic flavor to rum based drinks  i would say there is a strong nutmeg note here which can put some folks off  but i m a huge fan personally  it s tough to find bitters that work in tiki drinks beyond angostura  so this is a great addition to the bar for people that make a lot of tropical themed cocktails i was at the kentucky bourbon mixology competition recently and all the bartenders were making spicy flavored drinks  i looked all around for this stuff and finely ordered it here my first cocktail was great  oz  rye whiskey  or bourbon  oz  simple syrup  lemon twist  dashes of peychaud s bitters  drops of bittermens habanero bitters  start with   and increase from there  it gets hot serve it on ice this was out of stock almost everywhere and i nabbed the last one on amazon  it was part of a gift for my boyfriend for his new bar set  the something extra after the staples of regan s  angostura  and peychauds  and the smallest and most expensive bottle of the group  it has been worth every penny   complex  flavorful  rich  not overly sweet  a real winner  the bittermens website has some wonderful recipes  but we have been most enjoying it so far with a large rock    shots  a dash of regan s    drops or so of this one and a splash each of lemon and soda water this will spice up your average cocktail and turn it into a signature cocktail  i bet you ll enjoy it too subtle and slow building great with citrus and flavorful bases  like anejo tequila  gin  or golden rum bittermens makes some of the most unique bitters i mentioned to the bar tender that the secret ingredient in a mojito was a couple of drops of bitters  he did not have the angostura bitters so we tried the bittermens hopped grapefruit bitters  all i can say is ay  caramba the bitters gave the mojito a very refreshing taste this flavor of bitters is quite unique  there is a subtle warmth and profound chocolate flavor that is haunting  we like it in a tequila based coffee liqueur  add half a shot of good scotch and you have a drink worthy of the finest company you know for any tikiphile out there  these are a great addition to any tropical drink recipes  i substitute them in place of angostura bitters in zombies  rum barrels and   swizzles  they may be a bit niche in their application  but it s a wonderful product nonetheless one of the best tasting mix this is by far the best spicy mix on the market  you can almost eat it good product selection  priced right  had delivery issues good thanks excellent prices  but after a week and a half of hearing nothing i called to find out that my item  the customer service rep said it had been back ordered and i would receive an email once it shipped my item arrived the next day and i received the shipping email four days later  no big deal just takes a while to get items  but you cannot beat the prices easy to find item i wanted and at a good price easy process really good  the right battery for my motorcycle fast service and great prices  knowledgable sales persons  hugh in stock items  packing was excellent  doubled boxed easy to navigate website and easy to order process great job very easy and convenient i purchased for an island oasis machine  these work perfectly and taste great i love mango everything  i don t like pure sugar  this is so very thick sweet even if i try it in a frozen margarita  i am sticking with the citrus one it was so tasty  the bottle was gone way too early love the taste and texture  taste great mixed with the watermelon as well i love this flavor of mixer  my granddaughter even loves the smoothies i make for her  i mix fruit juice and mango daiquir mixer with ice   excellent summer drink  really hope walmart continues to sell this product  easy to order and fast delivery m mix this with ice tequila and lime than once serve top it of with chamoy my sister and i really enjoyed the flavor of this mix  it was truly like biting into a mango taste delicious  i even mixed with the ststrawberry follow directions  no more   no less  perfect a little thick but taste great this bitters taste good  but i knocked a star off because the artificial coloring in it stains surfaces  it s not a deal breaker  but i wish they didn t add the fake coloring great for old fashions it s one of the main ingradients in a  old fashion  very tasty good product  the small bottle goes a long way  too just what i expected good product great turn around and it is exactly the way i expected it works excellent as always this was exactly what i expected and it arrived quite quickly exactly what s needed for my favorite cocktail  whiskey sour i am a whiskey sour lover  but imbibing only when out to dinner  hubby suggested trying home  i was so happy to find this product my walmart supercenter  first  it s taste is great  not much difference in taste from mr  and mrs  t s  which is slightly higher in price  prior to purchasing walmart  wasn t aware they carried mixers   foolish on my part   duh  they have everything  i was paying like   to   per bottle other stores  at walmart  believe it or not  it is  so i stocked up bought   bottles  they also have it in a lite version sugar free and i thought that would be great not so  i drink suger free pop  but this doesn t taste as good in the sugar free version  so tomorrow i am going to exchange   of the bottles for the regular type  hey  a few carbs here and there oh well  love walmart  i especially love that you have the ability to check the availability of the product online before treking out  especially since the mixer is pretty much only sold the supercenters  and we have   within a   mile radius but only one has it fantastic   especially mixed with amaretto best mix i have ever purchased i buy it regularly love this mix i love the flavor and taste  great for amaretto sour i was happy with the price  i haven t used it yet good for mixing cocktails  a little more sour than other brands  but not bad the white label or the devil s cut dashed with some lemonade and lime cordial is how i enjoy my jim best drink you can get to make manhattens best bourbon i have found have toured distillery and love the brand red stag and coke zero is my go to drink  only wish more bars and restaurants stocked it  nothing like a good bourbon with a cherry kick  i like it with dr peper to sip and relax better than the other s drank it for years and always smooth and tasty  now it is running off the shelves at our liquor store i keep jim beam on hand every day of the week i typically have this neat or with an ice cube  its light amber appearance  sweet  woody  mossy nose  and its mild moss  white oak  mellow wintergreen mint  and dried  faintly candied fruit flavor draws the drinker into an exploration of pin point distilling execution  jim beam original has a gradual finish  with a ghost of chocolate powder  during the fade out  highly recommended  rjt it s does have a great toaste to it the only drink i ll drink i had a neat   finger glass two weeks ago of jb black label for the first time  i ve always drank jack daniels  and i loved it  no more jack for me best tasteing and defenetly the smoothest around i love it i always keep a bottle of jim bean in my liquor cabinet  value for price is incredible and it mixes great when it comes to making perfect margarita s  sauza signature blue  my go to tequila  anchor hocking     oz  goblet  frozen with a margarita salt rim  it doesn t get any better let s face it  distilled alcohol products aren t health foods  but clear liquor products  vodka  gin  white rum  and silver tequila  contain less toxic wood solute byproducts  tannins and formaldehydes  than heavily aged  dark  liquors  science aside  sauza signature silver is a splendid treat and delightful to sip  the clean  crisp agave taste that makes tequila so special is front and center without the woody heaviness of darker tequilas  tequila is an acquired taste  and sauza signature blue is a taste worth acquiring a taste to be savored great mixed or on the rocks one of my go to chardonnay wines for every day enjoyment  sam s has this well priced this is my all time favorite wine  but i can not find it all the time  and only in one store  would be great to be able to buy more than one at a time too  hard to find the bigger bottle more than once a month  and rare in blackberry most are concord    good too  i would love to be able to find this item in all of my local walmarts the whipped creme flavored vodka is fabulous  i keep it in the freezer and have a snifter of it when i want something smooth after dinner or as a night cap  love it i love this vodka  i have been drinking vodka for many years  and this is by far one of the best  and my favorite vodka  i drink it regularly  usually with grape juice  but also with orange juice  we use it to make daiquiris  and many other frozen concoctions with real coconut water or on the rocks  hard to find  love it a sweet smooth taste in every drop it s delish  the only suggestion i have is to sell a bigger bottle with a handle i love everything about jim beam apple  the taste is great and it goes down smooth  it s one of the best drinks out there with or without any added mixes i was hesitant to buy jim beam apple  after trying other apple whiskeys  but i was not disappointed  it s so smooth  light and fruity  very good very smooth  but very sweet  i would like to know how much sugar is added i mix the jim beam apple with a little ginger ale  it is a great summer refreshment it makes the greatest apple bourbon martini outstanding  smooth  easy to drink the apple jim beam is the bomb it s smooth no chaser needed i am hooked this is a great tasting refreshing drink great taste  great color  this is the only mixer i ll use this margarita mixer is standard for mixing good drinks if you mix per the directions it makes a great margarita by far the best mix out there for classic margaritas to enjoy during the summer months not too sweet or tart  makes the best margarita we ve had this is a wonderful change of pace if you like margaritas  you will not be sorry you ve given it a try i bought this for an afternoon with friends and it was super refreshing  really liked the quality of the mix make sure you use crushed ice  little to sweet on the rocks new flavor same great product pretty good for a quickie not as tasty as fresh made but still tasty and very convenient to have in your pantry especially with the holidays coming up cheapest price on the internet and with free shipping you can t go wrong great price for a great beer  ordered online  then picked it right up i usually make my own cosmos  but thought is would be quicker to use a mix  bad idea  this particular flavor was soooo sweet  i had to keep adding lime to it to temper the sicky sweetness  if you like sweet then this is for you  does not taste like a true cosmo with their recipe lucky tasty and convenient to have on hand  not as good as fresh juice but still pretty good this chalk is nice and sturdy  even for a rowdy   year old these chalk are cheap but i guess you get what you pay for because they don t write well   this is  by far  the best tasting mango margarita mix on the market  perfect for on the rocks  all other brands are thick almost like a puree  which is not good for a margarita on the rocks  that stuff is more for frozen daiquiris  this is the same consistency as any regular margarita mix  perfect we love it but can t seem to find anywhere my wife was tickled to death to find it i really enjoyed its taste and price  best mixer i have ever tasted i m hooked on the mango flavor of master of mixes  i love to put the mix in a blender and mix it with ice for a cold smoothie summer drink  i love the strawberry flavor too  anyone who like icy s would love the mango flavor of master of mixes as well as the other flavors also this is a great supplement to non alcoholic drinks  i e  green tea  my store quit having it available  however  i found it online here  great for entertaining and adding to punch  a little goes a long way very good product  a little disappointed in the price  much higher than in the store nice to have shopping payment options with great prices pretty good app  linked me to my other apps no punching in all your info over and over  quick n easy easy process was alright not much detail about item ease of use website i like that i could use my amazon account great easy to use quick and easy it was very easy  i am looking forward to seeing it  it s for my granddaughters truck very easy  tried o reilly s and that was a pain  i m ordering from australia quick and easy really helps get my digestion going in the mornings these were prefect additions to small stalking stuffer christmas gifts for fellow nurse s at work  just add a nip of choice i haven t tried the product yet  i bought these as part of some end of year gifts we are doing for our teachers  i m planning on setting them out and teachers can choose the one that they want  i didn t realize that each bottle is not individually labeled  instead  the labeling of the flavor and directions for mixing are on the outside of the box  now  i have to make labels for each bottle before i give them out my hubby loves this and wants to always have it on hand when my girlfriends come over yeah delicious we have fallen in love with this bread  it reminds us of the great sourdough breads we used to buy in san fransisco  it has the most incredible  rich  delicious sourdough flavor as well as the perfect texture  we stock up on it every time we can find it on the shelf at walmart  but it s not always there  please make this a regular item that is always in stock  there is no other bread that comes close to the quality of this one for the value its really good light and and just a little bitter sweet will buy again they are as good as pillsbury but cheaper they work perfectly for my homemade donuts good taste great cooks simple also awesome on apple dumping equilivant to pillsbury good product good as name brand very good  used it to make cheese sticks just as good as pillsbury but better price just as good as the popular name brand they worked really well  but they don t come apart easily  taste good though very good and at a good price taste good buy this item regularly very good very quick and easy to prepare and yet so yummy good love to use it with brie excellent was good very difficult to separate into individual rolls  i recently made pigs in a blanket with the name brand and the great value brand  i couldn t tell the difference  i buy this product often and will continue to do so not as good as pilsbury  the cressants did not come off easily  they stuck together buy walmart brand products all the time  compares to brand name products the dough stuck together and only made   somewhat triangles  won t buy this again   sticking with pillsbury i purchase these all the time  never had a problem with them these are very tasty rolls  i was a little surprise as how good  considering the price these are so delicious  easy to bake these crescent rolls baked up flaky and buttery just as i hoped  served with dinner no leftovers my husband who is picking like them  so that says it all it s a bit stickier than the brand name item  i believe it s worth the price to go with the walmart brand this product is great  cooks just as well if not better than name brands  the only kind i purchase now wonderful crescent rolls  excellent taste  these are my new favorite rolls they are as good as the name brand product  taste the same  but cost a lot less the dough was not was to unroll or separate these crescent rolls are just the same as the expensive ones this is chemicals ok for replacement but still not as good on brand name product i used this for a crust and it was wonderful actually  the great value crescent rolls in my area s walmarts come in a white package with black and blue writing   plus a picture of a couple beautiful crescent rolls  nonetheless  i expect my experience with this brand and product is applicable  i bought   dozen of the various types   flaky butter  reduced fat  and standard   and all had the same problems to some degree  although i was using the rolls up to   weeks prior to the  jun  expiration date on the end cap of the packages  the dough in many packages was so dry  old poorly stored  that it would stick to the packaging  and it was impossible to unroll the dough  i had to pry off chunks   and then try to put the chunks together like a jigsaw puzzle into some frankenrolls  the other reviews say the same thing   going back as far as   and now i m extending that same complaint to mid  why has walmart continued to deal with the same supplier despite the same problem for at least   years my recommendation  spend the extra   cents  or whatever  on the real thing  pillsbury crescent rolls if i could give these crescent rolls less that a full star rating  i would  i would even give it a negative star  of course  whenever you buy any pre made dough in a pop can  you expect a pop  well  nothing happenedat first  i had to bang it on the counter to open  and when it did  it was more of a bang than a pop  and dough shot out all over the place  the dough that was salvageable  in no way resembled a crescent  i had to form it into triangles by myself  of course the dough was so sticky that it was nearly impossible  the taste of the finished rolls did however taste the same as name brand rolls  but the measly few cents saved to purchase the great value brand was not worth the extra work  and mess to purchase  from now on  i know to go with a more reputable brand i bought three of these for the first time to make a new breakfast casserole  one package was opened right after taking them out of the fridge and was the bottom of the casserole  the second package was opened after everything was prepped and put into the casserole  it was useless and had to be thrown away  it was a ball of sticky  gooey  unshapable dough  into the trash it went and my husband ran out to get another brand  we had one pack left that i just used this morning straight out of the fridge and the rolls were just as good as the name brand  my little ones even had seconds  i think that the fact that they were still really cold when i opened the package and put them on the cookie sheet really helped this is a good product and it works as expected  i am not sure why so many reviews are there criticizing it  you are buying a dough and you got to mold it as you need  not sure being flaky and all is a valid critic for this product  it holds shape as it should and bakes nicely it tastes good and nice  this worked just as planned and i was able to make rolls as planned  will recommend   thank you walmart  first off  i could not get the package open  then  when i opened it  there was no way to roll out the crescent shapes to form actual crescents  i had to break off bits of dough  roll them in my hands  and make drop biscuits  terrible these were terrible  it seems like they are just crammed into the packaging  there is no way to roll them out into triangles  it just comes out all smashed together and impossible to actually make crescent rolls out of them  i ended up having to roll it all out and make my own  too much work  next time i will be spending the extra   or so and going with pillsbury  heck  i d even pay   more to not deal with this garbage first  let s establish that the whole point of buying tube crescent rolls is that they come off in little triangles that can be rolled into crescents  hence crescent rolls  these are no where in the vicinity of crescent rolls  the dough stuck together would not unroll  where i needed triangles  i came out with sticky amorphous lumps of dough  it was   useless for the recipe i was making  i was severely disappointed and will never again purchase these the dough looked like it was crammed into the packaging  i could not use it without combining the dough to roll out and cut wedges myself  then they came out hard and very small  it must ve been at the end of the line and what was left over  this has happened more than once  will not purchase again  the savings is not worth it crescent rolls are something of an extra for us  we don t buy them real often because of the price but  great value crescents are so good and the price is reasonable that we don t have of splurge  i make rolls  use them for crusts  roll apple slices in them and slice them in long strips and sugar and cinnamon them  just twist them and you hace a great and fast snack  good eating these rolls were much smaller than pillsbury s and much harder to get out of the can  they ripped and shredded making them just about worthless  i will not purchase again the crescent rolls taste good   but the last couple of times i purchased them they were so smashed together i had to build crescent rolls out of the pieces that i could separate great item  just like the brand name stuff  sad thing is sometimes  you can get the brand name even cheaper than the wal mart brand i like them a little undercooked  so i pull them out a minute early  i like the taste much better than pillsbury crecents  easy and fast to make  they make a great snack or roll for dinner purchased these with a sell by date of january   opened them november     and they were shrunk to   can capacity and smelled bad  the container was undamaged prior to opening they were just as good as pillsbury and i saved money they fall apart when you get them out of package  they are different sizes too  they look like someone just threw them in the package when you open it unlike pillsbury crescent rolls i tried making a breakfast star with the perforated rolls and even though it was good it was a little more difficult  this time i bought the seamless roll and they are as delicious and easier it was cheap and tasted good it was impossible to unroll this tube of rolls they would not separate and i took them straight out of the fridge  i wound up rolling out the dough and slapping together my rolls very unhappy this is a terrific product  just a few drops in bourbon  straight up or mixed with agave nectar and lime make all the difference  would order again this is an amazing mix just add rum  i usually add a little pineapple juice and a cherry  mix it with crushed ice  enjoy i was so happy to have located mr mrs t mai tai mix at wallmart on line  it is nearly impossible to find it in nj  grocery or liquor stores  usually  i am not a fan of any bar drink mixes  particularly now sugary ones  but this one is a fabulous concoction  not too sweet  the flavors are well balanced between sweet sour  with a touch of bitter almonds  just excellent to drink as is or it is very simple to prepare an exotic cocktail by addiing baccardi rum garnish with maraschino cherry and a sliver of pineapple  on a skewer  i have been impressing our guests with it the entire summer   had to even give up one bottle to my neigbors  we are hooked  wallmart send the product promptly for a very reasonable sh charge  it arrived in good condition  product is shelf stable  i ll be ordering it again next season  or maybe earlier if we want to have a nice summer cocktail in the winter months i like to add a shot of light rum and a shot of spiced rum  it s a little sweeter than i would prefer but not bad at all for a premixed drink  it has been a hit at our pool parties i ve tried a number of different mai tai mixes and this is the best one by far  but it can be hard to find in stores  i m glad i found it online so that i no longer have to worry about finding someplace that carries it  for my perfect mai tai  i use a combination of trader vic s dark and spiced rums  this mai tai mix  and a splash of orange juice i could no longer fine my usual brand  even on the company website so i started looking for a new mai tai mixer  look it up  these are complicated to make from scratch  i kept seeing this brand so i decided to order it and was very pleasantly surprized  this mix is a little more pineapple than the last  but i like that great valve and product excellent for those who enjoy  experimenting with bacics and coming up with one to call your own great taste  easy to use and has no high fructose corn syrup apparently our area distributor stopped carrying this  we have tried other mixes but no other tastes this good  thank you walmart  our summer porch sitting is now complete these were delicious  i wish they came in a  count tube  they are becoming my first choice refrigerated biscuits i grew up loving shasta  but i can never find their best flavors  it comes with lemon lime  orange  grape  and fruit punch  my favorite is the punch and  in my opinion  the lemon lime is better than most lemon lime sodas  the grape and orange are just okay  it is nothing special  but it is a pretty good value  also nice to have a variety of sodas handy on hot summer days  especially when having guests over we purchased these for an event at school and they were a big hit  everyone loved the variety  it is nice to have something other than the big name  brown sodas  i remember shasta from when i was a kid and it is still good  great value for the money it s really good for kids and they will love  it has a variety which is great this is great for the kids variety and the price is right easy and fast tasty my kids love these  quick on the go breakfast for busy moms  no syrup required really nice my child could eat one every day taste great  quick to fix kids love them the pancakes are a quick fix and my boys and hubby love the taste these are great for an afternoon pick me up or a sweet treat after dinner that i don t have to feel back about they have a good chocolate taste good value for the item  my son loves it as a afternoon evening small meal quick and easy before school breakfast taste great portion my kids loved these kids love putting this in blender with fresh or frozen berries little sprite got a good slush or smoothy we don t like this brand as good as the dailey s brand  but it will do  we can t find the dailey s anywhere  so we settled for this  we don t use it for alcohol  we use it to make smoothies with great smooth product great taste and great price i use this item in my smoothies  i like it better than having to use juice  this with some yogurt and ice very good favorite mix if you enjoy making frozen drinks at home  great flavor i purchased for an island oasis machine  these work perfectly and taste great i love the taste bloodmary mix  the best product in the market  this review was collected as part of a promotion best bloody mary mix to use in making red eye s  product is great  but was not received in the best condition  packing was terrible   every bottle has several dents and even bends in the neck of the bottle  this review was collected as part of a promotion mr  mrs  at its best  if you haven t tried it  you haven t lived  walmart is the place to buy no matter what size your bank account is it s better than making a bloody mary from scratch   perfect every time excellent i recently have begun enjoying margaritas  i havent done a lot of searching for different mix and am pretty sure that this one is a good bet  i like my margaritas on the rocks and this mix seems to really do the trick as far as flavor  the reason i had even picked up a bottle to try is because the local golf course uses this to mix their margaritas and so i thought it would be a good start for me  i didnt have to search long to find it and i actually paid a decent price for it  the container is easy to pour out of and is sturdy  i use jose cuervo to mix my margaritas  although i think any tequila would work  i dont shake mine yet because i still need to buy a shaker but i do give them a good mix  the overall taste of the mix is sweet and tart  but not overly powerful on those to senses  i recently mowed my lawn and had a cocktail as i did so  and the mix was just the right flavor to enjoy a nice summer day  i will definitely be purchasing more of this mix in the near future and maybe adding different fruit flavors to it to punch it up a notch  but dont get me wrong the flavor out of the bottle is very good a little to sweet  does not taste like a margarita should this order arrived with three broken bottles and the bottles were   ounces rather than   ounces like shown in the website very good in whiskey sours and long island ice tea  cannot find in stores  this a great deal especially if get free shipping cheaper to buy on amazon com  i believe  and i tried to cancel this order  but it got here so fast my head was spinning the product is hard to find in my area  therefore it s great to get it online and shipped to me in two days with shopping pass membership helps internal operations great way to get extra fiber for us this is a good product at a reasonable price  we have used it for many years  ordering online was fast and easy and having it shipped right to our doorstep was great  it was on time and we experienced no problems  just the way we like it chewing a tablet daily is a very easy way to get fiber in your diet and control the amount of water that you are drinking and when you drink it easy to chew the taste is pretty good too i have been using fiber choice tabs for several years and feel they help keep bowel movements normal  they are a little pricey at  cents per tablet  but are much easier to take than mixing powders with water   so convenience is worth something i m the computer person  but the good wife says that these cured her constipation   years ago and won t be without them works pretty well the only downside to it is it makes you extremely gassy which can be embarrassing at times have used this for a few years  so happy i can get them delivered to my home now  i feel these tablets help keep me regular each day these are great i started taking for fiber digestion but noticed they where clearing up congestion in my chest caused by allergies and the immune system building part of these vitamins where clearing up my allergies love these vitamins for many reasons this source of chewable fiber is my favorite  it tastes fruity and it is convenient   those two reasons alone keep me from not making the effort  i simply can t stand the orange drink fiber option   it has a gross texture and makes me feel bloated after drinking it  these are kind of a treat  some reviewers don t care for these but dont strike me as chalky  or stick to teeth  or anything  this review was collected as part of a promotion this do a great job but i like the orange fiber choice you no longer carry better it is fine  but it lacked the weight control feature that i was hoping for  my fault  i guess  but it s fine otherwise this product works great  i have been taking it for years  wish it would come without any food colors tasty little treats  gives fiber and fills the sweet tooth  no gassy side effects great product these are good tasting  easy to chew and swallow  just take one and i am on my way  no mixing of powder or measuring  i like them a lot and they seem to help with me being regular if you need some fiber to help you these are the ones to definitely get it helps digestion took forever for walmart to ship this item love getting a great source of fiber in a delicious tablet great it was a good choice for me  it was delivered on time  i order azo i ordered two  but only got one because the person who delivered it dropped it over the gate and my dogs got a hold of it  there is a note on the outside of gate asking the person who delivers packages to put it on the ledge  and for some reason the person didn t read the note great way to increase fiber intake best price around  quality product  works as well as other brands  like the chewies  got one of these for a friend as well as two for myself excellent choice  have never seen locally this ginger cocktail is great for tea  a mixed beverage or straight over ice  it is very soothing for a sort throat i bough my first few bottles in vermont where this is made  onlne purchasing makes it easy to acquire instead of driving   hours great to use as a substitute for ginger in your cocktail mixes  you don t get the same freshness you get from grated ginger but it does the job in a pinch and don t let the price sway your selection  we have served these wines from super bowl gatherings to most recently our thanksgiving celebration  everyone enjoyed the wines and when we asked what they thought they cost  they couldn t believe the value  love the belle made for you wines delio only problem they cooked unevenly this is my favorite quickie great afternoon snack i love this stuff  i like coco lopez but it is in a can which makes it difficult to use just a couple of tablespoons  i add it to my fruit smoothies and gives them just that touch of sweetness and coconut flavoring to make them pop  right now i am using it with an orange chicken stir fry  my problem is that i have been looking for it for about a month and cannot find it at the walmart stores where i bought it originally  while this is a great product i really don t want to buy a case of it  however  if that is the only way i can get it i may have no other choice  please start stocking this in the stores i was searching for coconut syrup at my walmart one day  and i found this coco real in the mixed drinks section  while i don t drink alcoholic drinks  i do enjoy mocktails occasionally  so i figured if it wouldn t work for pancakes  then i could make pina colada mocktails out of it and some pineapple juice  i shook the bottle good to make sure everything was mixed well  then used it on my hot pancakes at home  it was sooooo good  i usually only use pure maple syrup on them  but wanted some coconut syrup  this really filled that need so well  it was so delicious that i do believe i wouldn t even need to use butter on my pancakes when i use coco real as my syrup  it s not been easy to find locally for some reason  not even at the walmart where i found it once  i bought the last two bottles walmart had that day  it would be very nice if walmart com would make it available by the bottle without having to purchase an entire case at one time  i used one of those two bottles up pretty fast  but since i can t find it anymore  i am saving my remaining bottle for when i will get a real bad craving for coconut syrup  torani also makes a good sugar free coconut syrup that i would like for walmart com to keep in stock regularly  as well as their sugar free watermelon syrup  in the hot summertime  torani sugar free watermelon syrup makes such refreshing drinks  and it goes well with mexican food  which i really enjoy  it s the next best thing to liquefying cubes of real watermelon in my blender and chilled it was a great buy great product  i wish walmart could keep these in stock  they have been out of stock for weeks  great value  each popsicle is huge  come on walmart  stock these already i m a very picky about buying prepackaged anything  but these are soooo good i drink this all day but it would be nice if a sugar free version was available can t find it anywhere in stores and the price is unbelievable check some of the prices people are asking  just move to maryland from virginia all va stores always had it on their shelves  i think it s as close to hand made as you can find  i will always have some on hand as long as i can find it it took me   orders to get the right product  the collins mix was to sweet for my taste  i tried diluting the mix to cut down on the sweetness but to no avail  i found a product called polar tom collins mix which was almost perfect and can be purchased on line for a much lower price very good product hard to find locally i prefer to purchase this in the store individually but will do whatever s necessary to get it  absolutely a magnificent mixer took   tries to get the right order  the product itself is very good the best collins mix you will ever find this is the best bloody mary mix i ve ever tried  the balance of spice is excellent and when i add the amount of vodka called for in the recipe it makes a very tasty   and not too strong   drink  my order arrived on the day i was told it would  was well packaged and in perfect condition  very good value for the price  i will order again good for pina coladas  no complains this mix is overly sweet and probably could lose the high fructose corn syrup  it also has a soapy taste often associated with coconut oil  i will be dumping it out i use carmex all the time  love it  keeps my lips moist i bought this for chapped lips and i got instant relief this is my favorite i love the jar lip therapy the best i use

sore nose from a cold  i love that little yellow jar carmex has been keeping my lips clear of dry chapped lips and healing cold sor sores since i was a little boy  my mom would stand bt yhe door before we would go sledding and cover our lips w  it  its worked then and still workin today this product is fantastic  my lips are sensitive and when i use carmex original lip balm not only am i ready to face whatever the weather may throw at me but my lips feel great  i don t leave home without it and neither should anyone else i have been using carmex for approximately fourty years  carmex is the only lip balm that protects my lips from chapping  i personally know that if i did not have my carmex my lips would not be as smooth and vibrate as they are  thank you i tried carmex in the pot in   when my co worker introduced me to it  i was in my early  s and had dry chapped lips from the northeastern cold winter  started using carmex and within   days my lips were healed  never stopped using it if you wash your hands before putting this on  you don t have to worry about it a tube getting contaminated with a possible virus  you can even share it with friends  i also like that it isn t too glossy  the cooling sensation is nice too i bought carmex when i had a really bad case of chapped lips last winter after being out in the snow with my kids  a friend suggested that it would be the best remedy  it worked fast on my lips and it didn t leave an odd taste in my mouth i have been using this for awhile now  i suffer from cold sores and so many of the other products just dry your lips  i have found as long as i catch the cold sore soon enough carmex works just as well as the much more expensive brands i keep this product on hand year round it works wonders for dry cracked lips  once cooler weather hits  i make sure i have one carmex in my purse  once in my car and one at my desk  it is my go to product and makes my lips feel amazing when was a kid my mama would put carmex on lips then when she went to sleep i would roll the jar around the house carmex has been i part of life for   years and use it for my kids my   year old tries to eat it but now know how to use it i have been religiously used the original lip balm jar since i was seventeen and now i m forty one  i love it because of the fragrance and the silky feel  the taste is good too  i can t imagine replacing my carmex with anything else i have tried other enticing lip balms over the years but they never live up to carmex lip balm jar  i always come back to this for the same reasons it works  it moistens my lips for a much longer period of time than other competitors i have been wearing carmex since i was a child  i am   now and still apply it almost everyday  recently i was on mediation that really dried out my lips and carmex was the only thing that worked  love it  a must in my makeup bag purse we always purchase carmex lip balm in the jar  it is usually hard to find so when we do find it we empty the shelf to have it on hand  winters can be harsh in pennsylvania so we do not want to run out it keeps you lips soft year round my son cody always got chapped around the outside of his mouth  in the winter time and his cheeks we would put carmex on it ad within a day it would heal it up and it would be gone we love this stuff it seems to work on almost everything i have been using carmax for at least   years or more  i use nothing else for my lips but carmax  due to cold sores since i was   no other products work  no lipsticks  it is a everyday thing for me no exaggerating that is the truth i keep this on my nightstand and use it as part of my night time moisturizing  i love the way my lips feel in the morning  i forgot it on vacation once and could tell a huge difference  i love how lightweight but effective it is everyone in our house uses carmex for chapped lips but that s not the only use  my husband has found it to be most helpful for the cracked skin around his fingernails  it provides relief from pain and helps to heal these sore spots  too this was the first carmex product i tried  i remember putting it every night before going to bed and waking in the morning with my lips feeling rejuvenated and fresh  i also used it during the day to protect my lips from the sun i use this on my lips all year long for soft kissable lips  i also use it on my upper lip and outside my nose when i have a cold  i put it on at night and when i wake up in the morning you would never know my skin was sore or chapped i purchase about   carmex lip balms per month i enjoy the silky smooth texture it gives my lips  i love the feel and so does my husband  i make sure i always have a jar in my purse  car  work  every where  i really enjoy your product i ve tried lip balm in sticks and tubes  but the carmex jar is still the best container  maybe it s just habit but the unscrew and finger dip applies the protection and revitalization of carmex more satisfactorily than any other method i have used the original carmex lip balm jar for as long as i can remember  it s my go to for lip care  living at high altitude means dry air and chapped lips  so i keep carmex handy at all times  purse  bathroom  computer table  etc i have been buying carmex in the jar for over   years  i have found many other uses for carmex  for more than just soft  great  healthy lips  i love my carmex  and do not feel dressed without it  try it  you will love it  thank you carmex for keeping my lips looking and feeling the best i love carmex lipbalm  i have been using it since i was a small child  i love the smell of it  i use it all the time living in michigan you tend to have to endure some frigid winters  with the cold temperatures you also deal with cold winds that dry your skin and chap your lips  using carmex  you not only heal your chapped lips  you also create a great barrier that helps prevent them from capping again i ve used the lip balm jar for quite a few years now  needless to say that i have no complaints about it  live in tx where it is hot as heck and my lips don t dry out  just make sure you put it on before going outside  never put it on as your walking  you ll get sunburned lips  no joke i have been using the regular jar for over   years now  carmex is great at stopping a fever blister before it even gets going  i like the little magic in the jar  it is easy to spot in cabinet and easy to feel for in bottom of my purse  trust carmex it s the best and has been for years i have very dry and chapped lips  by the way i have a very bad habit  that i would like to rubber my lips when i feel there s dead skins on them  so my lips are often chapped and blooding  since i use this carmex lip balsam  i can keep my lips always im guten zustand  really love it i got carmex   weeks ago and when i got it my lips were cracked after just   days my lips were smooth and heeld i have been using this product since i was a teenager  long summer days filled with too much sun caused havoc on my lips  but carmex saved them  i still use it every night besides when i m in the sun  i have passed this secret down to my teenage daughters  who refuse to use anything else i enjoyed using carmex and it was good buuuuuut mih lips is still chapped dried and it feels rrrrrough on both sides so all i wanted is just to heeeeeeeal it up to get back to smoothness i have to have this little tub of moisture  the relief is unbelievable when my lips are chapped  also  i find it soothing when i ve been sitting out at one of my kids games all day in the wind and sun  honestly have one of these in my car  purse and the kids have them in their backpacks not only does carmex cure my chapped lips in no time  it also cures my sore and burned nose during cold and flu time  if you haven t tried it on your tissue burned nose  i urge to to try it  it works so good  plus  the minty eucalyptus type smell opens your nostrils    birds  one stone my favorite lip product for years  i always keep multiples around the house and in my car when my son was small  he got his own jar of carmex and he thought he was so big  he would put it on his lips  mosquito bites  any scratch  we bought carmex for every car and every jacket pocket  worked wonders even on the bug bites  carmex is an old family friend  trusted and loved i love carmex  however it is really difficult to find here in brazil it s been a year since i started using this product and i m glad to say it changed my lips for the better  i ve recommended this product to many friends who have dry  chapped lips like myself and they share the same feelings  definitely will be repurchasing this for a very long time carmex lip balm jar is my absolute go to when my lips are really dry  chapped or cracked  no other will do for me  it s smooth  not greasy  and leaves my lips feeling soft and hydrated  there s just something about the little jar packed full of relief that is a must in my household  in the jar is best  it goes on so creamy smooth soft has a hint of vanilla scent a sweet taste w  just the right amount of menthol  carmex is the best lip balm  period  i can t stop using it  especially in the winter summer months  you just don t mess w  or replace a classic i only use carmex and i use it year round  summer  wind sun burned lips spring  wind burn for extra moisture fall  extra moisture winter  cold sore chapped lips  all seasons for all reasons  the jar just makes it easier for carrying  when i stock up storing  thankyou carmex   i don t know why i like the jar better than the tube or stick  but i have tried them all  i will always use the jar  everyone says i have an addiction to carmex  carry it in my car  purse  next to my bed  in my desk at work  yes  it works  i lip my lips a lot and it stays on my mother used this on me when i was little and i continue to use it today  i thought i was strange because all my friends always had chapstick but not me  i had my carmex and the most awesome thing in the world is that both me and my boyfriend use it  i guess we are just that awesome occasionally in the winter i get chapped lips  not something that happens often  but when it does i absolutely must have my carmex in the jar  it is the only thing that heals my lips fast  i ve tried other products  but carmex is the one i depend on i have been buying this product for many years and wouldn t think of buying another brand  it has stood the test of time in protecting and healing my dry chapped lips  keep up the good work  i recommend this product to anyone  cheers  for carmex loyal customer  fan unofficial pr person for this product  aka best lip balm ever  always perfectly moisturizing  healing and effective long after initial use  perfect as base  lip balm or solution to chapped lips  cold sores and more  stock up works really well during the day for long lasting moisture and overnight to loosen up that gross dead skin on your lips   smells great i go through a bunch of them  my younger brother often tries to pull one over on me and snag a couple jars the jar container is my other favorite because i can leave it in my car without worrying that it will melt and leak like the ones in the tubes sometimes do  i love that i can have the product at hand no matter where i am or where i m going i have used carmex since i was a little girl  i frequently get cold sores and this is the only thing that helps clear them up in a timely manner  i have tried the more expensive treatments and none worked on me  i don t leave leave home without it i have used this product for years  literally over   years  i work out in the weather and it heals and protects in all types of weather  have one in my vehicle and house i have a problem with cold sores   usually keep abreva on hand  but i have found that carmex really helps with the discomfort of having a cold sore  so in addition to using it as a moisturizer  i now use it every time i have a cold sore outbreak carmex is a must have in my family especially in the winter time  our grandmother taught us to buy the carmex lip balm jar to keep favorite earrings in when it was empty  i love how smooth it makes my lips feel and how long it protects my lips i bought this   days ago as my lips had become sore in the cold weather  unfortunately i had a burning sensation on my lips  i washed it off and tried it again the next day with the same sensation this stuff may not smell the best but it s perfection in a jar  it s smooth and thick but not greasy and will protect your lips especially in the winter  i use it to help cold sores heal but i also use it to help protect from them  affordable too i have been using carmex since the mid  s when it was still in the little glass pots  i keep the empties and refill them  there s something about the weight and feel   i have used a lot of different lip balms and carmex is the best by far i had dry lips and my lips were pealing and my husband knew i needed this because i had an engagement to go to and i wouldn t go looking like this so he bought it for me and said use it and it worked in a few hours and my lips looked a lot better this product seemed to help my cold sore heal faster  i ve never used it previously and this time my cold sore only lasted a few days  and didn t seem to get as bad as it usually does  amazing for the price  skip expensive abreva and use this i have been using carmex original for many years  i have tried other lip balms  but nothing works as good as carmex  i have a bad habit of chewing my lips and i apply carmex every night and by morning they have healed  i won t use anything else i have never run out of this caramel for as long as i can remember  i keep at least   on hand at all times  there is always   sitting next to me  never stop making the container as i feel it works quicker and more effectively that the stick i bought this on a whim around   days ago  and i m so glad i did  the results were instant and my dry  chapped lips were gone straight away  and it lasts for hours  definitely purchasing again i have used this since i was little its my favorite lipbalm too i can buy lipbalms but i will still perfer this one i use it every night before i go to bed i ve been using this product for   something year s it s always been there for me  it taste great and it sooths  and heals sore chapped lips  thank you for making such a great product i have been using for over   years and love  keeps lips soft and full  rarely do i even use lipstick for color  i prefer original jar texture to other containers  hope to use the rest of my days for lovely lips i started using carmex as a cna  it is the only brand i can count on to heal my supper sensitive and dry skin  i wish you sold a larger container i bought it six months ago  i never have any lip balm as good as carmex  it is very cheap and i dont have to use a lot carmex on my lips  but it helps on my lips i ve been using carmex in the jar for a long time  it s my favorite product to use on my lips  works nice on cracked lips  especially on the side of my mouth  one or two applications and the red dry cracks are gone i have been using carmex for chapped lips since my lips were always chapped when i was a kid  my dad gave it to me and said this works great and dad s know everything  that was   years ago and i still use it today i remember being a kid and my grandma used to use this on the entire family during cold  winter months keeping our lips healthy and soft  never missing carmex in my purse i now continue the legacy with my children i have been using carmex for   years  my old containers list alum as an active ingredient  your new original formula does not list alum  what gives ive been using carmex lip balm for many many years oh yeah ive been talked into trying others but always came back to carmex theres nothing better and it works fast carmex lip balm is my forever go to lip balm i love the original jar carmex lip balm  i can t live without it during the dry and brutal winter every year  it save my lips from look like flicking fish scales to smooth as baby bottom lips  i absolutely love it the long time favorite container now has a severely indented bottom end this allowing for less product  very disappointed by this new implementation  smaller for the same great higher price i buy the carmex in the tub becuase it is how my mother always had it we wood open it up and smell that wonderful carmex scent  glides on smooth but its scent is what i love the best no other brand smells like it i have used carmex for years  i have tried other products but nothing compares to carmex in keeping my lips protected from the heat of summer or the cold of winter  thank you for making such an amazing product the original carmex is my go to product  i use this every morning after washing my face and this product makes my lips feel like silk the whole day  the carmex jar can last me a couple months too so that s a plus this is the only lip product i use  i wouldn t get through the winter without it  sometimes when i have a cold and my nose is sore i will even put a little bit on my nose before i go to bed and it really helps i always prefer this one because it s really very smooth to lips til the very last in the jar  unlike the other lip balm that s not do their job after couple use  so i always stick with this one  the original i buy these often and try to keep   in each purse  love the reliability of the product  it s great all year long  but especially during the fall and winter  great for use before applying lipstick too i ve used this for past   years  bought it one winter and realized not only did it heal my chapped lips but i use it nightly and feel it s keeps my lips from getting dry or cracked overnight  love the smell too this little jar s contents are the item to go to when those stress or seasonal painful eruptions appear on my poor husband s lips  saves the day everytime and it applied soon enough shortens the time of distress i carry one of these in my purse all the time  i love that it is in a small jar so i can find it with no problem  it works great and my lips and they never get chapped when i use regularly  i love the product i always have a jar of this in my purse on my desk  i ve used this product since i was a kid  this is the only thing that i don t get sick of  that doesn t explode all over my purse on hot days  it keeps me from chapping during the winter  which is more than i can say for any other lip product i bought carmex several years ago when i had a big bad break out of cold sores that spread all over my lips  with in   to   weeks of using carmex my lips and the cold sores were pretty much gone and the cold sores have pretty much have never come back  i have also gotten my brother to use carmex to i absolutely love carmex and am totally addicted to it  i love it so much and use it so much  that i actually kept all of my jars for a whole year to see how many i use  it ended up being   jars in a year  i always have   in my pocket    in my car    in my purse l  and   by my bed at all times i have used carmex branded products for years  my favorite is the jar  i apply this at night before bed as well as during the day  it stays on better than most other brands and my lips stay smooth and soft  i recommend all of the carmex products  they are inexpensive and work wonders for your lips i love it because my lips get chapped real fast and i grabbe it and that is my ride buddy and do melt fast but it is good using i had this laying around in my medicine basket  and one day i picked it up as a last resort to other lip repairs and i have to say i should of gone with this atype the start i know alot of people don t like potted lip balms but i am just the opposite  carmex not only keeps my lips soft and healthy looking but i really love that carmex tingle and the scent is the kind of different i appreciate  i ve been using this since highschool and i m   so its a life long love i have been using this product since i was a child  my mom swore by it and now as a mom of   i swear by it  it is the only product that i can put on my kids or my lips before going to bed and wake up with completely healed lips during winter and cold and flu season  best lip product out there this is the only chapstick i use  it works amazing and a little bit goes a long way  fixes chapped lips and doesn t have a nasty taste or smell  since they are small and compact i keep one in my car  my purse  the medicine cabinet  and next to my bed  this is definitely one of my must have items i have used carmex lip balm as far back as i can remember  it has been around for ages because it works  it s a great value  it s never sticky or greasy  does not taste or smell weird  like some other ones  is the best value  buy multiples to have them at home  work  in your purse etc i have used carmex for a very long time  i have a jar at work  at home  in my purse  when i feel a cold sore coming on  i immediately put some on my lips in my opinion  it definitely helps it heal much quicker  my kids know if their lips start to get chappy  they need to get their carmex on carmex in the original jar is my go to for everything from wind chapped lips to winter cracking and anytime my lips just feel a little dry  it works the best every time and although i ve tried just about everything else on the planet  nothing beats carmex  carmex beats everything for anything the current jar i am using  i got from my mother s house after she passed  my siblings were going to throw it away  i told them to take their hands off of it because she ad just purchased it in december  and this was march  the best lip balm my mother  bless her heart  ever introduced me to you ive been using this product a couple of days now ans has done absaloute wonders for me  ive always suffered very dry lips no matter what abd have always used vasaline that never worked  my lips are so soft and no cracks anymore this little tin of carmex is amazing  seems to last forever and

than blistex a few weeks ago i was looking for the lip balm that i usually buy but the store didn t have any  i saw carmex s lip balm jar and thought i d give it a try  so glad i decided to  i really love it and the way it makes my lips feel  now i know what one to buy the next time i need more carmex i was introduced to this when i entered the army  in the px there was tons of this stuff  all of us recruits got a jar and boy were we glad  it helped us get thru a horrible oklahoma winter    years later i never forgot how it saved me and still use it to this day  i m sure those guys do too out of all the lip protectors this is the only one that works and i have tried a lot of different chap sticks trying to save money or wanting to get a good flavor or just the right color doesn t matter carmex is the only one that works thank you for making it my sister has used carmex in a jar for years  she would even put it on her eyelids at night  lol not quite sure why  but never had sagging skin there  i loved the fragrance started using it myself way back when  i will never use anything else  it really conditions my lips i ve used carmex for years and am very happy with the product  i m just curious  did the formula change it seems to smell different  maybe my sniffer has changed  please keep up the good product for as long as i can remember i ve been using carmex on my lips  this one in the jar is my favorite  the smallest bit goes the longest way and you ll probably lose it before you run out  i love applying it before lipstick so my lips stay nice and moisturizer all day long been using this stuff as far back as i remember  don t go anywhere with it  tried several other products but not as good  started with the jar  then the tub  and now the stick  highly recommended  don t even bother trying anything else  when you have the best  why bother a month ago my lips along with the rest of me got very sunburned and i tried the blistex i had and it wasn t helping at all  i was in the gas station and picked some carmex up and wow instant long lasting relief  thought to myself  wish i could spread this all over my body i really like carmex in general  i started with using the jar when i had chapped lips and i was sold the first time  by the end of the day i could feel my lips healing up  now i have long nails so i have graduated to the lipstick looking carmex and i love that one as well i have been using this for years literally  i am   and have used this since the  s i love carmex  love the small container that it comes in  it really works for me a lot  especially in winter time  my face gets really dried out   i use a little bit on the dry parts of my face   it works great  thanks for such a great product  i buy nothing but carmex it works so great on my cold sores  the moment i saw one coming up and i instantly put it on and the irritation stops  then i swear it sped up the blistering and leaking time as well and now it s scanning over and healing right now  love it i buy this all the time and i have at least   open at one time in my purse  by my computer desk  right on my night stand and of course one riding my car  i have dry lips all the time and carmex is my best friend it keeps my lips soft and moist and kissable for my husband coming into spring my lips were so dry that i couldn t even open them right up  lipstick looked bad on me and was embarrassing  i tried nivea  manuka honey lip balm and more  a week ago i heard the ad on the radio about carmex  so i stopped to buy it  best decision ever the others seem only to provide a barrier over the lips whereas carmex actually moisturizes and heals them  i love this stuff  i ve used it exclusively for as long as i can remember  let everyone else try what they will   i ll have only carmex i have used carmex lip balm jar ever since i was a little kid and though people make fun of me because i m old school i don t care i love it  it gets the job done and keeps my lips smooth and protected  i appreciate it and so does my wife    thanks carmex i have used carmex for years  it is the only lip moisturizer therapy that works for my lips  i have tried many others including all the name brand type but carmex is the only one that works every time  i use it winter and summer i bought this one day hoping it would help  that was   years ago and i have used it every night since  we keep   on my husbands night table and on mine  my lips are slathered when i go to bed and when i wake up  they are baby soft  love my full pout with this product i v been using carmex for as long as i can remember i m   now i tried others but always go back i like the jar because you can use what you need and it s like an old friend when lips are dry the old yellow and white jar is just the ticket   btw i miss the glass jar  you can always rely on a jar of carmex to relieve your chapped lips all year round  i especially use it throughout the winter and keep one in my pocket  and the nightstand  and the kitchen  and the desk  i ve even used it on my nose when i have a cold to protect it been using lip balm for many years  tried just about every brand  carmex has been the best for my lips  i stopped trying brands after carmex  and when the can was introduced  wow  takes away any disadvantage of tubes rollers always keeping my lip protection protected last year i was having a lot of trouble with very dry chapped lips  tried chapped stick  which normally helps  but this time it was not  so i purchased carmex in the jar and started using it and immediately started to see relief  i keep it handy in my bathroom i have been an avid carmex original lip balm jar user for years now  i don t think i could ever use anything else  i love the way it moisturizes my lips without feeling waxy or gunky  the price point is completely reasonable as well i have bought many products for chapped lips  i bought carmex one day years ago and loved it  carmex is the best  i don t buy anything else now  it is also good for coldsores  i love the cool feeling on my lips  carmex rocks back when i was little and complained about my super dry and chapped lips i remember my dad handing me a little jar of lip stuff now i have all forms of carmex but this one holds memories as i apply it to fix my aweful lips worse case of chapped lips ever  desperate we stopped at a drug store and sked for the best and fastest cure  was advised to use carmex  it started working right away and in a few days the lip licking and soreness had disappeared my mother used this product  and now i use it and so does my grown daughter  it has worked well to heal cracked dry lips and i ve tried lots of products over the years but always come back to carmex  now  i won t use anything else carmex is my go to product most of the time when my lips are dry  i love the original jar just because thats what i grew up with i think  but i really love all carmex products  i love the smell  feel and how it helps my chapped lips living in the desert  it is a struggle to keep my lips from drying out and cracking  when daily summer temps are over   degrees daily  protecting my lips is important  the only thing that works is carmex  i prefer the original jar i used to use eos and i found out that i was allergic to it so i stuck with carmex  carmex is the best lip balm in the world our family loves carmex  you will find carmex in every room of our house  our cars  we are boyscout leaders and we all have carmex in our backpacks  our kids all get carmex in there stockings for christmas  can t live without it carmex jarred lip balm reminds me of being a little girl and going to the water park with my family  my mom would put it on my lips to prevent them from being sunburned  she always carried it in her purse and now  so do i   i buy this every year  its a must have for the winter months  not only is it great for your lips but its also great for the rough egdes of your nose when its chapped  always has been the greatest product  and it also smells good i have been using camex in the jar for the last   yrs  i used it once in the morning also again before i go to sleep  i enjoy the way it feels and protects my lips  my wife says i crazy for as many times i apply the wax to my lips i have been a fan of carmex for years  i wish i could remember when i first used carmex for my cold sore  but i m sure it was   years ago and i never leave home without one in my purse  love  love  love this product thanks this is the only lip balm i purchase  my lips get dry easily and i get a cold sore a couple times a year  once i feel a cold sore coming on  i apply this and can feel it start to work immediately  i would recommend this to anyone i have been using carmex since i was a little girl because of my mom  carmex is her absolute favorite lip balm and i don t blame her  she has also been using carmex forever  i have never had a lip balm work as well as carmex carmex is the only thing that saves my precious lips in the blustery windy cold of western ny   remember buffalo last year  i have used this since i was a kid and i cant imagine ever changing because this works the best i have been buying these little pots for years not only to heal my lips but to protect them this product keeps my lips soft and full and free from painful cracks during the winter as a pharmacist i also recommend this product this is the product i remember using the very most it seems as a child it was just always around us all the time  for cracked winter skin  then when the heat came out and cracked even more just great to have handy always the minute my lips can t take anymore of the harsh conditions of the florida sun i reach for the cooling and soothing relief of my old stand b  carmex lip balm in the jar  i apply it at night and by morning my lips are healed  this is a go to product you will rely on again and again i have used this product for over   years  it is part of my makeup routine before applying lipstick in the morning  and used throughout the day  i don t know what i would do without carmex during the winter season living in the midwest  it keeps my lips moisturized and looking great i always keep carmex on hand  it is always nice to have during harsh summer sun or cold ia winters  gives your lips healing security  toss it in your purse or keep it in your pocket always there to heal  nothing compares for those dreaded cold sores that peak during the flu season there are harsh cold winters and dry summers in chicago which can really affect my lips  moisture and protection is what i wanted and so i bought this product for those reasons  not only did it deliver but it also healed my chapped lips  only negative is that i have to use my finger nearly   been using this for years on lips and cuticles  i wish the packaging didn t change  the inverted bottom isn t right  wish there was a vegan version was available  how is the lanolin derived for this product my favorite before all the changes i have been using carmex for decades and will not use anything else  we lived in maryland in the late   s and i could not find it there  when i came home to kansas i bought enough to last and some for other people from kansas that were there too  i highly recommend it to anyone ive been using this for   years and so far its been a product i use every single day  its my go to product  honestly its so amazing  after scrubbing ur lips put this on and ur lips feel amazing and smooth  and results are great in the morning when applying this before sleeping i have been using this product for about   years  i started because i was getting very chapped lips and nothing was helping  i use it in the morning and at night everyday  have not had chapped lips  or cold sores in   years  i recommend to anyone who has problems with their lips i have been buying the carmex jar as long as i can remember  the reason i have bought it for so many years is i was in the military and would throw it in my bag work bag  i never had the jar crushed or come open even when the bag was tossed around and all my gear would hit it we us both use the original jar and tube  my son use it all the time  i buy it in bulk  mu son use it a lot  he is outside with sports  so we have to keep a lot of it  we don t see much of the other flavors  just strawberry or cherry  we stick to the originals jars and tubes i buy this type of carmex all the time  it is my favorite one out of all the choices  i am always using it when the corners of my mouth crack  it is the only product that i have used that heals them  i absolutely recommend this product for anyone who has any type of lip issue i have used carmex for over   years  i don t go anywhere without a tub or stick  it keeps my lips soft and moist  and protected in the cold winter months  especially while skiing and snowshoeing  the only thing i d ever change is i d bring back the mint flavor  it was the best in middle school when my lips started to burn like crazy  had to go the doctor  they said i had wind burn n told me to go get some carmex  really but it did the trick    yrs old n it help me from get rid of my wind burns on my lips each time i get them  thank u i have used carmex for as long as i can remember  the fragrance is what drew me in  i thought well  at least my lips will smell good but i was pleasantly surprised at how moist and smooth it kept my lips  i have a jar of carmex at my desk  one in my purse and i never run out having a daughter with excema is hard so when ever she suffers from sever dry lips and cold soars i always can count on carmex to deliver  works amazing and helps heal dry chaps lips  love how its helps the itchy feeling and protects her lips from sun exposure and cracking i have been a big fan of the carmex jar since i was a little girl in elementary school  this would be the only product i would let my parents buy me  living in northern minnesota a person really needed this  i love the little yellow jar and the smell too  best product ever i love this product  it s the original and the one that i first used b c my dad always used it and swore by it  i love how quickly it works and that is works so great  really keeping my lips from getting chapped and cracked and once they are  it works quickly to heal them i have been buying this version of car next lip care since i was   i am now   years old  it is a regularly used part of my beauty regime  keeps your lips soft smooth for hours  using this product regularly also keeps those dry  irritated winter lips away  it s amazing i bought this size container for my dad very often  he always had sore corners of his mouth  and he loved the round container  he wanted to always be ready for kisses  from me and his nurses  and it always healed the corners of his mouth w o a bad taste  he used it daily i love this stuff i was addicted to bliss stick but for the last   years i ran across this at the store it was so smooth and not greasy on my lips and i have bought it faithfully every year i don t really care for the cherry but i will use it even my grandkids call it by name they have to have their own personal one also we love it the big thing in high school was to always have car ex in the jar  i graduated in   and have been using ever since  i may not be able to find my keys  money  etc  in my purse  but i can always find my carmex  leaves my lips feeling soft and smooth and cures dry chapped lips in no time  i can t live without it  love this product i bought this   days a ago and i m a first time user of this brand and not sure if i use again as my lips are on fire every time i apply is this a normal reaction or am i just using the wrongs thing because thousands of people across the world rave about how amazing it is feedback would be great to hear i had tried a new lip butter  but went back to carmex original lip balm jar because it lasts longer  and is less expensive  i used to apply lip balm sticks during the day  and carmex jar at night  but the lip balm sticks don t last  so now i use the jar all day  too  i even bought a package of   jars because it saves me money i grew up with this in my house  my mom always had some that she used all the time in the winter also whenever she got a cold sore  i never had any colds sores  so i do not know if it really helps with that  but i do know that it is great for those dry cracked windburned lips that those of us living up north get every winter this is my go to lipbalm  i apply in the morning maybe   am  and i let it sink in and all day i have the feeling of comfort  no dry lips  no reaplying  unless it aroung the time i go to sleep  perfect solution for dry lips  it gives my lips a healthy look  it s also great to apply before lipstick  im so happy with this product nostalgic  classic jar  heals raw feeling cold sores or chap with ease  it s a must for me in florida helps fade dark spots of dark skin  economical price  easy to find in stores  i first started using it years ago after a pharmacy employee recommended it as an over the counter cure for my inquiry on healing the side of my lip i ve been using carmex for more than   years now and i have literally nothing bad to say about it  i can t leave the house without it and it really soothes my dry lips  i even use it now as a primer before i put on any lipstick just so that my lipstick sets moist and nice  this item is highly recommended and very addicting   d my sister has a jar of this and i have to say i just love the tingleas you can literally feel the product rejuventating your lips  it s not as greasy and some other products which is great as it does not feel like you have a layer or oil on your lips haha  carmex also smells amazing and is worth every penny    from me i have using this farmed in the lip balm jar for as long as i can remember  not o lyrics does it help the moisture of my lips but that little jar has been a part of just about every life event  it attended my wedding  the birth of my children and numerous other events  to me it is more than a way of life it is part of my life i come from a long line of carmex users absolutely could not live without it  i keep at least   bottles  if not more  in my home at all times  one in my purse  one in my bathroom  one in my living room so that no matter where i am there s carmex nearby  that tells you how much i use it love it    i highly recommend it i have loved carmex in a jar since i was a little kid  i am biased as i m from wisconsin and carmex is a wisconsin company  but that just means they understand how chapped lips and skin can get  this is the only thing i have ever used that actually works and it works overnight most times i have dry skin on my lips  i love it for   years i gave been sort of addicted to always have carmex with me wherever i go  i can t sleep unless i have carmex on my lips  i love carmex and i will always use it and nothing else because carmex is the best for my lips i have used original carmex in the jar for many years  it never lets me down  it gives me the relief i need and the healing that i want  it s tried and true for me and i ll continue to use it for years to come  i ve tried the other carmex varieties and tje tubes but the original jar is my favorite  a bit of nostalgia for me i bought this originally to soothe my painful cold sores  it was one of the only products that actually worked and didn t make them dry out  i continued using this product lonnnngggg after cold sores were a problem in my life  it is so soothing and moisturizing  i m definitely a carmex snob  no other product works this good my daughter introduced me to carmex lip balm  i use it every day  and find the initial tingle when applied so refreshing  but i find it difficult to find stockists for it  can you tell me of all places that stock it in coventry one day after years of battling chapped lips someone suggested i try carmen so i did low and behold it worked better then any other chap items i had used whether it was chapstick or vaseline or any lip balms etc i still put a small coat on my lips even if they are not chapped just because it prevents chapping and feels good ihave used this product since i came back to chicago in   as a home care rn i have been exposed to the elements over and over in a day carmex has saved my lips  i stocked up buying boxes as my son entered kindergarten as he always would leave them somewhere as young boys do he s   and still using the products thanks i use nothing but carmex for chapped lips  this is my all time favorite package because it is rugged and durable and can go anywhere   from being tucked into a jeans pocket to the bottom of a backpack  easiest method to apply just the right amount too my family and i have been using carmex for decades  it is the best item on the market for keeping your lips and mouth healthy  i even send my daughter in wisconsin   carmex products since the winters are long  a third generation is now using the product better than any other treatment for cold sores  does not dry it out and heals faster  one more area it is great on is sore fingernails  yep  that s right  ever cut too short that it hurts  try putting some carmex from the jar on it  relieve is on the way ever since i started skiing in colorado and found out about carmex it is all i will ever use  great lip protection in all weather conditions  i have been a loyal user for over   years  other products come and go but none of them ever match up to carmex i had an appointment with a new dentist and she put carmex on my lips to keep them moist well ever since that day i always buy carmex i love this product it keeps my lips soft shiny moist and stays on long too  i would definetely recommend this product  carmex  has helped my dry  thyroid cancer skin  i just love this  my lips  and such get so dry  it is a perfect product  i love the jar  cause it fits in the purse  glove compartment  pocket  etc  lasts long also  only a little dab will do it great price on this very good product i m a huge fan of carmex and the little classic jar  first off carmex feels great on the lips and the smell is very appealing  the little jar is just so old school i m glad it s still available  i highly recommend carmex over all for your chap lip needs my mother was actually buried   with a jar of carmex in one hand and a kleenex in another  she was never seen without either  i would purchase the carmex jar by the box for her  she would have a jar always within a few feet  if not closer  to her i am  by far  the first to go the natural route for anything  however  carmex is the best lip balm that i have ever found  there just isn t anything quite like it  healing  penetrating  numbing  if i could be addicted to a lip balm  this would be it i have been using carmex forever  when you see the little jar you know that relief is just seconds away  this original product reminds me of going to the drugstore and seeing the little jar right by the cash register  great memories of a great product i use this product religiously  if i forget it at home when i go to work  i get another jar on my way to work  i can t go without it  my lips are always dry and chapped  as i am a lip chewer  and carmex always helps my lips heal  and stop hurting i dont know when carmex was invented  but i was   years old when i started using it my lips were split and blistered from the cold wisconsin winter  the pharmacist in our local drug store recommended it  i still use it today and i am   years old i ve been using this for years it is awesome  works for dry  chapped lips  even works on break outs  yes  it works on pimples  try it  it works  i always keep some in my bedroom  one in my purse one in the bathroom  love it  thank you  carmex carmex original lip balm jar has been a staple in my life my entire life  its a must in the car  purse  backpack  diaper bag and i wouldn t be exaggerating if i told you it s in every room of my house  it just simply works  no muss  no fuss  no waste if i don t have   carmex in my bag  i don t leave home    pot    stick    tube  i think am addicted   truth is am prone to cold sores and need to use it often to safeguard my lips  wish you had special deals for clients who can t live without it i ve been using this carmex product for many years  and it still works the same as it always did  carmex does a great job keeping my lips moisturized  especially in colder weather  even when i don t have dry lips  i consistently moisture with carmex i bought this and it is really good  but is smells really bad i have been buying carmex since i was a teenager  through the years  many new products have came out  i have tried them all  in the end  i always found myself back to using carmex  the only lip product that has worked for me  time and time again love that smell  works great too  and congrats on the sponsorship of the lambeau college football game in sept  what a great honor  i hope to make it  go wi and go bucky i love carmex original lip balm in a jar  i use it all the time  it works not only on your lips  but also for problem skin areas like ears  hairline  chin  elbows  etc  i love the consistency and the flavor  it lasts a long time and helps to heal any kind of skin  just wish it came in a larger size than   oz  i would love a   or   oz size  i put this stuff on every night before i go to bed  it keeps my lips happy  healthy  and soft  plus  i like the tingle  i had a boyfriend who hated that i do that because he didn t like anything  squidgy  on my lips in the event he might want to kiss me  boyfriend gone  carmex still on my lips every night  enough said  choose your battles i ve used carmex ever since i moved to this arid climate and spent a weekend at a friend s house that lived off the beaten path  by sunday my lips were parched and i was miserable  we went to a local store and i lucked upon a shiny tub of golden lip relief  i keep   of them in the house  a couple in my truck  and a couple more on my desk i buy this every time i need something for my lips  its the best i even buy some for back up  to have some put back just in case  i don t use anything else  i definitely recommend it to my friends and every one  its good for everything if i have dry cracked lips or chapped lips  anything its my go to saver  i love it  nothing else compares i ve been using this product for umpteen years now  my family is prone to getting cold sores  i ve been getting them since  st grade i m now   i only trust this product as all the other stuff out there is way to expensive and doesn t work carmex is fantastic and works in a very short time  i use every product on the line now i love it be it a high end lip balm  round ball ones or anyother that has been on the market for long carmex by far works the best than any other  i also noticed that it doesnt chap my lips if i stop using the product  i am not addicted to this mild but beautifully scemted charm   thankyou for pampering me carmex  i keep the jar next to my bed  it s my favorite thing i have found for my lips  it stays on all night  and i wake up with soft lips  i like the light scent  the way it feels  it works so well  this is also one of the best things in winter time  nothing else works as well  it is cheap  bit not cheaply made  budget friendly fantasticness i love this product  my family has been using this product for years and every time i see a jar it brings back old memories from when i was a child  i love that they have not veered from being their original self and are still a brand my family trust to this day  great product and you can always count on it to help protect your pucker i have been using carmex for over ten years and i am lost without it  there is two jars in my purse  one in my car and one in my desk drawer at all times  i have not had a cold sore  chapped lips or flaky lips from the sun in these ten years  people talk about their daily exercising  well my daily care includes a dip for my lips  carmex maybe more a question then the review  i have been using original carmex for years  recently i bought   pots of it and i was shocked  as my beloved salve seem different  smell texture and feel is rather questionable  this is a lot   please tell me you have not change the formula i m a girl that adores her chap stick  though my trusty sidekick did nothing to fight off my extremely chapped lips that i had last week  i bought a jar of carmex and with only a few applications  my very dry lips were back to normal in   hours  thank you  i always buy at least   jars of carmex to have on hand    are at home and   is in my purse at all times  winter weather is fast approaching and i have severe dry lips and usually get a cold sore at some point and carmex softens and protects my lips throughout the winter months  very reliable and trustworthy to get the protection done i ve used this carmex in the original jar for as long as i can remember  my mom started us on it when we were little and to this day it is still my go to for chapped or dry lips and just a good moisturizer over all and i love the menthol  there is nothing else like it  i have one in my truck and one on my nightstand at all times as soon as a cold snap occurs  it time to buy jars of carmex  leave it in bathroom  kitchen and bedroom  this way you have access to it  all the time  the climate gets very dry   and zaps your lips  for me  carmex is never out of reach   the best product to keep your lips from chapping especially when shoveling in cold winter months i have bought so many of these in the past years having a son in the military this was a life saver for when he was in iraq and afgahanintan he was my oldest and then my middle son uses this daily and has started his daughter to use it and my yougest uses this also and of course i do too thanks for having such a great product this original carmex has been around since i was a child  i remember i used to get painful chapped lips from playing outside during the winter when i was little and my mom would always use this product to help heal soothe my lips  it is a product that has stood the test of time and is still available today and for that i am thankful i have been using this for years  my lips are always very soft and this is the only lip care item that prevents fever blisters for me  my   year old daughter swears by it too  i buy   at a time to make sure we always have plenty on hand  i have bought more expensive products and always come back to my carmex  i love this stuff i have been using carmex in the small glass jar  i believe it is plastic now  for many many years  i have always loved the distinctive smell of carmex and the tingle when i piut it on  the jar may seem tiny  but it lasts for a long time  i have carmex by my bed and in my purse and i have even tried carmex lotion and love it too how can you go without using the carmex in the original yellow jar  i use carmex all day long  a preserver for my lips   days a year  even my dentist keeps the jar in the drawer for patients to keep moist lips  i drive every other week to atlanta and the carmex is always with me  a life saver and preserver for me and my family i was   when i first started to use it  i went to visit my granny and got a really bad cold sore  she got carmex for me and the cold sore was gone in three days  i have been using it ever since and i m   now happy i love the jar becuase i love touching my lips and i love the idea of being able to control the amount of carmax you want on your finger  the jar is also most ideal when wanting to share with friends and family as you don t have to worry about their lips touching your stick  each person gets their own individual amount  the jar is the best  also if you happen to get a cold sore you don t have to scrape of the top layer on the stick wasting product as to prevent the cold sore from coming back and spreading  using a jar keeps your lips from wasting product having cold sores has to be one of the worst and discomforting things ever  when i first tried carmex  i immediately felt relief  really it s indescribable how awesome carmex is  i have used pretty much every other line of chapstick or any lip reliever in the market l  but none have come close to carmex  since i started using carmex  that s all i use  i keep two in my purse and i keep at home as well  my lips are finally kissable  thanks to carmex  thank you for such an amazing product  god bless you guys for helping so many i use to suffer from very dry  cracked lips year round for years  i have tried every brand on the market  websites  by chance i saw this product gave it a try wow  i ve used this every day night for the past   yrs  the pain  discomfort is a non issue    it keeps my lips hydrated  no chance for cold sores  my lips are ready each day  thank you so very much for this awesome product  i ve shared these as stocking suffers for all my friends and family  the cost is so reasonable also  thank you again from happy lips in cuyahoga falls  ohio   i use this product particularily in the cold winter months  and it does a great job of protecting my lips from the weather  i put this thick gel  a little goes a long way  under lipcolor during the day  generously on my lips as a conditioning treatment during the night  and on the skin near my nose when i m sick that gets dried and irritated from blowing my nose  this product works and is a budget friendly staple for anyone s makeup collection  my only complaint is i m not a fan of the smell  in the future would love a less stinky medicated scent i usually always buy carmex when it comes to lip balm and the original jar is one of my go to carmex products  i do love the cherry and tubes but the jar is very convenient to have around  and less likely to lose  it lasts forever as well  i apply it every day  multiple times a day and it still looks like i haven t made a dent in the product after a month  it keeps my lips moisturizer for hours and doesn t leave a greasy residue or doesn t feel sticky like other lip balms do  highly recommend this to keep at your desk for work or in your purse i know people claim that carmex is addictive  and i know that you claim it s not  either way  i love it  i slather virtually half of my face with it prior to bed each night  i don t wear it during the day  because i don t like feeling the least bit greasy  anyway  i just wanted to tell you that i love carmex  i once forgot to bring my carmex with me on business trip  and i was stuck buying an over priced chapstick in a hotel lobby  and boy  is that stuff junk  it felt like i was spreading old cheese on my lips  this is an any day must have are used to lick my lips causing them to become extremely dry with a dark ring around my mouth and my lips peeling   my cousin suggested that i try carmax this has been years ago   i now carry comex everyplace i go it s in my car in my purse beside my bed i can t be without it it has become my best friend my lips are no longer dry sore or cracking i would recommend this product to everyone my  year old nephew man uses it because he was experiencing the same problems i had it he no longer has that problem thank you i ve used the carmex original in the lip balm jar for as long as i can remember  ever since someone introduced it to me either in late elemtary or middle school  so many many memories are associated with this simple little product that has grown up with me for   years  i love how it s never really changed except for some minor changes to the jar during those years until now these genius additions to the line that has only made it better thank you carmex for being there being such an important part of my ever changing life i can t even tell you how many years i have been using the carmex tub  but i will never use anything else  i love carmex  i am totally addicted to it and my lips are always so soft  i put it on every night before bed and my lips are good the whole day  i have tried so many different products for chapped lips and this is by far the absolute best product on the market  the price and quality of the product are incredible  the other ones out there don t work and cost too much money  keep it up guys  i love you i have been using carmex in it s familiar pot since high school  i remember it like yesterday  the girls gathered in the ladies room between classes to gossip  giggle  brush our hair and put on carmex to soften our lips  we had to be ready just in case the cute boy we crushed on spoke to us  we wouldn t be kissing in class  but  we followed the ritual so our lips would be perfect  i still love the feeling of it on my lips and taking that  st inhale  that makes your lips tingle and your thoughts travel to a sweet memory i love keeping a jar at home for use before bed or if i need it during the night  i also keep a jar for each of my kids especially during the winter  when lips get chapped the most  they lick their lips and cause that ring around the mouth that this product helps get rid of fast  they keep theirs by their beds in case they need it during night also  i like the how smooth it is and the scent is also very pleasant  my kids like the smell of it especially when having a cold  it seems to help them clear their nose better i remember back when i was a small child  my father would always be on my case about putting carmex on my lips because they were always so sore and chapped  of course a   year old wouldn t care  until the winter came  my lips were so chapped and i started getting cold sores all over my mouth  so i finally listened to my dad about putting carmex on my lips  ever since i started   i never stopped  carmex is such an amazing product   my lips have never again got crusty and i haven t had a sore since elementary school i began using carmex in high school  i had really bad acne and started an acne treatment that really dried my face and lips out  the dermatologist told me to use carmex  i am now   years old and i still use it  i have to put it on in the morning after applying my makeup  and reapply several times throughout the day  then after i have removed my makeup for the night and right before i go to bed  i reapply  i cannot go to sleep without it  my husband uses it almost as much as i do  excellent product  thank you when i open a jar of carmex  i can t wait for the cooling smell it has  soft as butter  goes on like silk  protects my lips from wind  rain  and sun  i wear it to sleep to keep my lips moist and supple  i even use it in my nose when the house is dry to keep it loose and soft  i think carmex is the best on the market  low in price  high in quality  i ve used it for many years  when my kids were little i would use it for cold sores and chapped lips and cheeks  keep up the excellent work  sincerely tina d utecht i ve been using the pot carmex since the  s  i have loved it all these years  back in the day anyone we were with would say  can i use your carmex it was the only lip protection referred to  someone always had carmex on them  after all these years  the pot carmex has not lost it s fabulous ness  there s just something about applying carmex to your lips with your finger  try it to see how smooth it glides on to all the right places for instant relief  and a healthy little shine to your lips i have been using carmex for over   years because i get cold sores every year and i have used nexcare and abreava and those are way expensive too and i noticed that those take a week for your cold sore to hear and so i tried the carmex and it s like gone in a day  i actually got a cold sore yesterday   and it s gone today  i told my daughter about it a while back because she had a sore and she even used it  i even recommend it to a lady at the store but i don t think she took my word for it so  i bought my first carmex three years ago i think  because i saw a friend had it  i just love it  i use it when i wake up  during the day when needed and before i go to bed  my lips haven t been dry in three years  how amazing isn t that i have used one of this jar  and i am halfway through the second one  so one and a half jar in three years   amazing  i also got the cherry one recently and i love the scent of it  ah  this product is just perfect and i really recommend it to everyone i have been using this particular carmex product for several years  the original lip balm jar has been a staple in my purse and in my   kids christmas stockings every year for the past several years  three of my kids are grown and they still want carmex for christmas  i give them several jars so they have it all year  this product keeps lips from chapping in the minnesota cold and also from the arkansas heat    i have lived several years in both states  i love this product so much the name says it all  the original that started all of this carmex craze  i don t know about all of you  but i graduated in   carmex has been going strong for years  even since i was in school lol love it can t live without it  also  all the other carmex products flavors are totally amazing  i just figured i would go with the original because it is the single product that started these amazing products  that actually do their job do it properly  thank you carmex if you never tried it  it s time for you to do it  keep your lips moist and healthy i m going to do a review on the  st product made by carmex  because this one is the first one i have ever tried  it s what got me hooked on this lip balm where it all started  i tried this product when i was   years old  my lips were so chapped that it was so painful and red  as soon as my aunt and uncle purchased it for me  it stopped my pain right away and within a couple of days  it was gone  i have never had a problem with this product and as of today i still carry carmex in my purse  a  for this product made by carmex and it s affordable  thank you for making my life easier  your   fan lia anderson  from flint  mi i grew up in a skating rink  that means i had multiple mothers and fathers watching out and over us  it also means i had multiple grandmothers that were willing to share their knowledge  this product is part of their knowledge    years later and i am still using this product religiously  i keep it in my pocket  i keep it in my hunting backpack  i keep it in my truck console  i keep it on the nightstand  i mean this product is within reach   not only does it help with crack and chapped lips  it also helps with cold sores  i now share my knowledge and love for this product every chance i get  great great product always use this and it works a treat however there is a massive dent built in the bottom of the classic jar which makes it look like you are getting more for your money  the squeezie tube is better value for money   same price with more product i ve been using carmex for the past two years  this product keeps your lips moist and smooth  i got to say that before i started using carmex i normally used to get cold sores and other cold sore products did not help at all  i tried all of them  like abreva and spent so much money on products like that and my cold sores took a long time to heal or got worse  my friend told me about carmex  so i tried carmex when i had the sores and i it was amazing how my sore was diminishing and was gone so quickly  i always keep carmex in my bag  dresser  in my car  definitely would recommend this product to friends and family i am prone to severe chapped lips  if i don t use chap stick every day my lips dry out to the point that they crack and bleed  unlike most chap sticks which work for a few hours then need to be reapplied  every   or   hours  the carmex jar is long lasting  i can put it on twice a day  before work and before bed  and my lips are fine sometimes i can even get do fine using it just once a day if the weather isn t harsh  if its really cold or dry i still only need to use chap stick mid day once when i use the carmex morning and night  which is a vast improvement  i love it  added bonus the jar is my favorite color i bought my carmex jar about a month or so ago because i live in georgia and it s so easy to get dry lips with this hot  dry weather  so  i decided to try it out  after one week my boyfriend and i both noticed changes and my lips are so soft now  he however doesn t like carmex do to the oily feeling and the taste to him is rather undelightful  however one day i left my jar in the car by accident and when i came back it was melted  the hear from outside actually fully melted it  but after bringing it inside it came right back to life and have had no problems with it  i was rather happy about that i ve tried countless lip care products from countless brands across different price points  and nothing beats the carmex original jar  it instantly soothes dry lips and regular application helps keep your lips looking and feeling great  this formulation is great to use year round as it s emollient both in colder and hotter weather  do yourself a favor and apply as liberally and as often as possible  you won t regret it i just brought this carmex lip balm because my lips are very chapped and dry and i love it and it s cute little container that i can store pretty much anywhere i have never used a lip balm as much as this one and have only had it for   days and i have already seen a improvement in my lip moisture and no other lip balm has shown that much improvement for me so soon and i have stocked up and brought like   more to last me for a month i hope but i might need more but i like how it feels minty or refreshing on my lips so i plan on sticking with your product because it s perfect for me  i have used carmex for many years but for a while i had forgot about it and it got pushed to the back of a draw  however recently i found it and remembered how moisturising it is on the lips and that great tingly minty feeling the balm gives you  i always have dry chapped lips but using carmex has allowed my lips to heal and make them feel soft  now i could not live with out it i have a jar in all of my bags and around my house and apply it multiple times a day and before bed i apply a generous amount to work as a lip mask over night to give me luscious lips in the morning i am a lifelong carmex user  not only does it keep my lips from drying and cracking during the searing summer months and frigid winter months  but when i used to play in the marching band  it was an indispensable tool i would never go without  playing a wind instrument in extreme weather conditions can be murder on your lips but carmex s invigorating healing power kept my lips fresh  safe  and protected   even under the most punishing conditions  it doesn t wear off easily like some other brands and you can actually feel it healing your lips immediately this stuff works miracles i ve used this product in the pot for over   yrs til it came out in a tube  i ve used the tube ever since  i ve tried everything on the market and nothing works like it does  i still don t like the smell or flavor but i m hooked  i ve tried the cherry and didn t care for it at all  have you every thought about vanilla or mint in the tube because i find the vanilla in the stick to be the right smell flavor but i don t like the texture and it doesn t last like the original on your lips  thank you i have tube all over my house and everywhere i go  if not i have to stop and buy some this product is awesome  my nose and lips were raw from a nasty cold  carmex soothed and healed this severe chapped skin in seconds  i was looking for a product with the healing product of lanolin and was pleased to find it is the second main ingredient  thanks to carmex i m back to feeling great i discovered carmex original lip balm more than ten years ago  since then i ve never used a different brand  the soothing difference is like night day  i am constantly recommending carmex lip balm to all my friends even acquaintances that display an immediate need to get some relief from chapped lips cold sores  as i know beyond a reasonable doubt that i end up a hero  without exception they love it  too can t believe they ve just discovered it  i always have an unopened unused tube with me that i then give to the newest convert  the love is overwhelming  thanks carmex i ve exclusively used carmex for   yrs  it s the last thing i do before going to bed at night  my lips have not been chapped once in all those years  there soft and supple always  i prefer the original pot over all the other carmex  not only is it on my bedside table but in my purse  it s always with me  i ve three daughters that use it before going to sleep at night  and it is with them everyday of the year also  all i can say is that it is simply the best lip product ever  i recommend it always when someone has chapped or dry lips or just want smooth soft lips always you don t know how lucky you are to have carmex lip balm in a jar  i came to texas from miles away to find lips here are spoiled every day  they are being moistened with a balm that makes my red and inflamed lips  super calm  plesant aroma that is second to none  and pretty soon you will have yours all gone  not to fear tho carmex lip balm in a jar  cuz everyone here knows who you are  just ask and you will see who has that balm takes only seconds and its in your lucky little palm  i love carmex lip balm  never fails to heal my lips and keep them soft and moist this is the only product that heals cold sores completely  i had never had a cold sore before  but a few weeks ago  there it was  i went to the pharmacy and bought an expensive medicine specifically for cold sores  not only did it not work  but actually made my lips itchy  as i have been using carmex for years for my dry and chapped lips  i thought  okay  i ll give it a try on this cold sore  like magic  it s gone  this is a phenomenal product  and i am super grateful to the people at carmex for consistently making high quality products  from my lips i say  thank you i found this product back in the  s  i walked into my local drug store looking for something that would work better on chapped lips fever blisters  my go to was chap stick before finding carmex  i found carmex to be so soothing restorative for my lips  i use it under lipstick or by itself everyday  for me  it keeps fever blisters manageable if i get one  super moisturizing in any weather  i never leave home without one form of it in my pocket or handbag  this lip balm jar is my go to now before bed  please never change your product  it works it works well my sisters used to use this all the time  they ran through jar upon jar of it as i was growing up  considering i was a good   years younger than them  i just thought they were weird teenagers  but when i turned   i was on the swim team at school  and the other girls were using it for their chapped lips  we had horribly dry lips due to the constant lap swimming we did in all weather   times a week  and after   days we had amazing lips  this stuff is the real deal  the girls who didn t use carmex were looking a little raw faced at our trials  we used it even on our cheeks to help with windburn  and it was phenomenal for elbows too  it really does work for everything  and now i know why we had so many empty tiny yellow jars everywhere after many years of using various other lip balms  discovering carmex was a game changer  i will never use another lip balm when i bought the new carmex that s in a pkg  rather than how they used to sell it in an open box i noticed that it went up in price  not a big deal  since that happens with time  everything seems to go up  but what i was upset about was that  even though it looks like the same jar  if you look underneath  the indentation goes up so far  that it is about half of what you used to get  i have an old glass jar  and compared to the new plastic one  the indentation on the bottom is at least half way up  now i ve noticed the ones that are not in pkgs  have a tight plastic sticker on the bottom to cover up that fact  i haven t bought any carmex since  i was going to email the company  but they sent me an email to review their product i have been using this for at least   and a half decades  and love it to death  my only complaint is that i actually miss the old glass containers it came in  fortunately i still have one  and often fill it up with the contents from the new plastic container  while i know it is the same stuff as before  i really miss the white glass containers it came in  even though i know the new plastic containers are safer  i still like the nostalgia of those glass containers great product better then abreva  price is fair better then most products let me first start by saying that i have suffered from severe chapped lips for as long as i can remember  i literally layers of skin peeling off from my lips little by little  suffice to say  it can be quite painful  while i visited my doctor  i brought up my issue and he commanded carmex  i was a bit skeptical but i went for it anyways  i have tried so many remedies before to no avail so why not another attempt well  let me tell you this is my very last attempt because carmex has improved my condition tremendously  it is not only soothing and moisturizing but helped with the peeling and the chapped lips  now my lips are baby soft  supple and stays hydrated for long hours  i could not ask for a better lip balm my wife bought this cream a few month ago and to be honest i was under the impression that it would be like all the other balms  oh boy was i wrong  this little wonder balm is the cure to my chapped limps and the cure to my cold sores  yes cold sores  in fact it beats all other cold sore medication out there  when i use regularly  meaning i don t lose my jar like i often do  it prevents chapped lips and cold sores from reappearing  plus i love the tingling sensation you get after you apply it  i recommend it to all my friends  now that i found this product  my pharmacy does not carry it anymore  now i have to find another place to get it  with the help of the website i think i found a solution  thank you carmex ever since i was little i have used carmex as my go to chapstick  i love everything about it and i could never find a better lip balm  it s not just something to put on your lips when your lips are dry it also works wonders if your lips are cracked or hurting from being too dry  this product is a must have in your purse at all times  love love i purchased this delightful little jar approximately two weeks ago  in preparation for the impending winter months  and the inevitably chapped and cracked lips  in the vast world we all live in today  we are often overwhelmed by the huge number of choices we are faced with every day  even when it comes to something as simple as which chap stick we want to purchase  i can t thank carmex enough for forever making this little choice easier for me by creating a lip balm that is by and far above the rest  their simple yet elegant design combined with their no nonsense  get the job done formula make this the obvious choice for anyone looking to have healthy  happy lips throughout the holiday season my lips are almost always chapped without carmex  i ve had dry and chapped lips for so long and i ve tried everything  blistex  eos  chapsticks  lucas  pawpaw and even medicated lip ointments  i recently picked up a carmex over an  instinctual urge  and i don t think i ve ever looked back since  carmex does wonders for my lips  they re so smooth and soft now   even my boyfriend has commented on them  the consistency is just right  not too thin and not too thick  i ve found with lucas  pawpaw  it s only good for chapped lips and blistex and eos only gives me a thin layer of lip balm  i like to apply lip balm before i sleep because my room sits at a cool   degrees celsius  i find that because of the consistency  carmex really absorbs and heals your lips while you sleep  blistex leaves a thin coating on my lips when i wake up whilst pawpaw doesn t absorb very well either and sometimes dries out my lips even more  i recommend this little tub of goodness to everyone and anyone who is looking for a great lip balm or lip remedy  i ve only needed to apply it   times daily  and i have extremely dry and chapped lips from my medication and it works wonders for me  i really love my little tub of carmex and it s by far one of the best lip remedies i ve picked up   at such an affordable price as well i was introduced to this product back in the  s and this is yet by far the best product that i have used and will ever use  it keeps my lips moist and supple  i go out of my way when my pharmacy that i shop does not have my product  however i have learned now for years is to stock up  and that is exactly what i do  thanks to carmex for this unique and exquisite product  i d love to be entered into a commercial if you d allow me   smile  i recommend this to all i encounter  lastly  you have gotten a bit expensive and really there was no need  people who have used your product know quality  but i think your prices are getting a bit profuse  nonetheless i do stand by you  excellent for dry cracked lips  great product  love it i started using carmex when i moved back home to chicago in   a co worker at the hospital turned me onto carmex  she told me it was a staple for winters in chicago  i have used it ever since and i live in the southeast now  it s not just good for sore chapped winter lips it s perfect for surfing  a lipstick base or gloss  or just dry lips  believe me  just ask my hubby  i have jars in all my cars and my purses and stashed everywhere so it s always handy  i ve traveled the world with my original carmex in the jar  carmex has been with me to mexico  jamaica  the bahamas  and all over the usa  i turn everyone on to carmex that i spark conversation with while traveling  my mom would always keep this jar of carmex stocked in our bathrooms and nothing else was used in our house  well  i am all grown up now and i had run out of my beloved carmex in a jar  hubby came home with some other brand that was immediately thrown in the trash  he obviously did not understand my love for the familiar soothing scent  the way it immediately took care of my dry lips and the yellow cover with the white pot  i found it in the store  picked up five checked out  in the car  tore into one of those wrappers  opened one of those pots and that familiar friend was back  my chapped lips were slathered with the soothing lip balm once again beginning in about  rd grade   approx   every fall i would be cursed w  a huge reddish purple ring around my mouth from having severely dry lips literally using my upper lower lips as my chap aid  spending the afternoon w  my grandmother  she stopped at a local pharmacy to buy me a tube of chapstick the pharmacist helping her suggested that we try a new aid handed her a little yellow tin tub of carmex suggested we try it  i used it non stop for the next few days  and amazed my whole family w  how well fast carmex did the job  i have used nothing else ever since  my lips belong solely to carmex  many thanks carmex i have been an avid user of carmex in the pot for the last   years  i was living in wisconsin when i started using this product in high school in the  s  i then moved to florida and they did not have carmex in the state of florida  i was distraught and had to have my mother send me shipments of carmex so i could survive  i have a pot of carmex in every room of my house  my car  my purses   everywhere  i have tried all of the other lip products out there and the only one i find absolutely reliable everytime is carmex  my lips have stayed so soft for so many years and i never have chapped lips  carmex is the best thing since sliced bread i have used carmex original lip balm  in the little round jar  for many years and it has always come through for me  there are not many products out there  that i have found  that work consistently and do exactly what they claim to do  but this one does  at the first hint of a cold sore  i grab the carmex as quickly as i can  and apply it  it stops the cold sore from progressing and heals what is trying to pop out  if i can t find my little jar  i panic and hurry to the store to buy another one   no one wants to go around with an ugly cold sore  i ve always thought it amazing that a product that works so well  would be so affordable i got my carmex the first time i started having really chapped lips and it works wonder when taking this acne medication called roaccutane which causes lips to be dehydrated  the orange flavor liquid lip conditioning tube has worked wonders for me these days  i also used the original jar but right now i don t remember where i put it so i haven t used it  from what i remember it has a nice refreshing scent and also calms your lips from burning due to the extreme dryness so i recently moved from pennsylvania to colorado  huge elevation difference  a few days ago  a friend and i went to garden of the gods and i failed to bring chapstick  the result was me linking my lips way too much and i suffered tremendously the next day  my lips were on fire  the day after that  my lips were so severely chapeed  i didn t even want to go to work  well  of course i went  and i bought this little miracle in a jar  within just a few hours  my lips were   better  still chapped as they needed to heal but i was so shocked at how quickly carmex soothed my lips  amazing  i love it i love this product  i would definitely recommend it somehow i found this balm in romania  in a little store  i decided to buy it  the jar was so interesting  the price was good  too  but i must admit  my expectations weren t very high  i have a lot of lip balms  and none of them really works  and then  such a big surprise  the menthol  the camphor  these aren t very usual for lip balms  but they did a good job with my lips  together with the other ingredients  it became my favourite balm in the world  i would be sooo happy to try the other products  but  unfortunately  it s impossible to buy these from here  and to bring them from the usa it s too expensive i buy these tubs by the dozen at a time  i use my carmex   and carry it with me wherever i go  can t leave home without my carmex   product works wonders at keeping my lips from chapping and keeps my lips supple and soft  thank you carmex   and yes in my picture  my carmex is in my coat pocket  i am in love with this lip balm  the original pot version  i love the way it makes my lips feel  it makes them feel fresh  smooth  soft  this is the only lip balm that doesnt irritate my lips  other lip balms and glosses leave my lips numb and itchy  this doesn t  its like a miracle in a jar  i never get cold sores  but i use this like an everyday lip balm  it is wonderful  if you like wearing lipstick  and sometimes have those annoying dry peeling lips  put some of this on your lips while your getting ready  then wipe it of and apply lipstick  i like that its not oily greasy like the blistex in the jar  carmex has the perfect texture  the smell is like the original chapstick smell  lol it kind of reminds me of the smell of a new baby doll s skin  kind of powdery in a way  but i like it  it s so cheap  only   cents at my walmart  so worth buying  you wont be disappointed  you can also use it on dry hands as well  it s long lasting too i bought this and it s always working the best on my lips  i love that when i wipe it off my lips are soft with no cracks and it helps with all my sores  this product is the best i bought this like a month ago and recommendations wasn t as well i have been using carmex since the  s when my mother introduced me to it  i in turn introduced it to my husband  he cannot do without it  due to his addiction we probably keep     jars stashed around the house and in the cars  one on each side of the bed  one in the bathroom  one in each of our cars  there is always at least   in the laundry room  freshly laundered    in his desk drawer and a couple of brand new ones  just in case  my only disappointment was the day i went to buy an new jar and the package felt different  my beloved jar was now plastic  my little wonderfully feeling porcelain  i believe  jar was gone  i have to admit  that month i searched for my beloved jar in every store i went  in the hopes that they had not sold out of them  only to be replaced by the new plastic jar  i don t know about anyone else  but i would gladly pay an uncharge to have my beloved and true classic original jar back once again im happy with this product works well especially on dry lips i used to use the cherry chapstick from the brand chapstick and their cakebatter flavored one as well  but i stuggled with them in combination  one would work or the other would but neither were helping me  so eventually i searched for something new to help relive my dry almost papery lips  i tried the original carmex and i was in love after the first two days  i put it on as soon as i got it and slept with it overnight  when i woke up it was like my lips were never damaged  i love carmex and thank you so much i have bought this lip balm few days ago  never heard of it before  best product ever  fell in love with it immediately carmex delivers like no other lip balm  hands down best product i have been using carmex original lip balm in the jar since i was a child  i remember my mom getting out the little tub of carmex putting on my lips before i went out the door  winter  spring  summer  or fall  when i was a teen there would always be a little jar in my christmas stocking along with a tube now that i wanted to wear lip gloss  i never went to lip gloss  just my carmex  as my own daughters came i would put a little carmex on their lips before they left the house too they got a little tub in their christmas stockings  now i have granddaughters who get a little carmex on their lips before they go out from me their moms  they also get a little jar flavored tubes in their christmas stockings  all these years later at   yrs old it s still my go to lip quencher season after season a christmas stocking favorite it was in annasiriya  iraq that i was introduced to carmex and have been a true believer ever since  we were pulling security at the ziggurat of ur while the iraqi s had their very first meeting at an attempt at self governance  we were in the hot sun all day and at the end of the day i had a blister on my lip that looked like a cigarette had been put out on my lip  a fellow soldier suggested carmex  i was given some and it worked like a charm healing this burn and preventing any more burns  since that time  may   i returned to southern iraq in   and spent january   to february   in kandahar province afghanistan  and every time i took a good supply of carmex that saved my lips from burning from the extreme sun found in the area i told everyone that if they wanted to send me a care package to please send some carmex my friend bought it for me and it feels good on the lips my grandfather and father both used this product  i ve used it my whole life  it not only is a multipurpose product but it brings me back and remind she me of my loved ones  i love carmex  especially the jar  please don t go anywhere  ever i m from a generation of wisconsin families who have had carmex original lip balm jars faithfully in their pocket  purse  backpack  and bathroom for over   years  from harsh winter weather to scorching summer sun  along with dry lips and a few cold sores thrown in between  carmex has relieved it all  from the first sight of the jar wanting to be opened  to that unique sound of the tiny lid being screwed off with a pleasant aroma that greets you  and finally to the tingly lip sensation after application it s happiness to my senses  i use it instead of lipstick for a natural shine several times throughout the day  and at night before bedtime to avoid chapped dry lips  the carmex original lip balm jar will continue to be one of my wisconsin traditions that i ll highly recommend to my family and friends i have always gotten horrific fever blisters and tried everything to soothe them   if you re not aware  they are very painful   anyways  a friend of mine asked me if i had ever tried carmex and i hadn t and had honestly given up hope that anything would ever work  so  i was out at my local drug store and seen the carmex and picked up a jar as a last ditch effort   boy  was i so glad that i did  carmex has been a life saver for me  i know that sounds shallow  but it s the truth  i felt immediate results and my fever blisters healed quickly and the carmex soothed them  needless to say  i have jars and tubes of carmex every where in my house  car  purses  etc  you can never have enough  i use it multiple times a day and my lips are so smooth and protected  thank you for such a wonderful product  carmex carmex is my favorite lip balm ever  it always helps my chapped lips  i love it its great i love using it  but i suggest you guys make a bigger jar or a family sized jar so it can last longer my lips always keep super dry during the winter regardless of how much water i drink  i ve gone three days with chap  awful lips and finally remembered to pick up carmex  it never lets me down  i m sitting here now with soft  soothed lips and it reminds me of how when you re super sick as a child and your mom comforts you  normal chapstick never does the job  if people taking the time to write reviews about a lip balm tells you something  it s something positive i remember when i first was introduced to carmex  my mother put it on our chapped lips in the winter  i remember the tingling feeling on my lips and i loved it  i still use it today  and when friends ask me what do i use  instead of the usual chapstick or whatever else most people use  i always say carmex because it works well  it s actually the only lipcare that i use also perfect as a base before i put on lipstick  it just absolutely works  that s it  a lot of other brands work for an hour or few  but with carmex your lips stay moisturized well  and helps to prevent cold sores  although i don t get them  it s nice to know that it also will care for them  not only fo rthe cooler months  but all seasons  especially when winter comes  carmex it is love carmex  but really wish it had spf protection when my lips need soothing  carmex does the trick helps to soothe my extremely dry and cracked lips i use it everyday  it makes your lips smooth and soft i started using in the summer my lips are so soft keeps lips moist for a long while but could be better love this product  the packaging  even like the smell i bought this awhile ago and i love it  it is great i buy this all the time  it s a wonderful product carmen is great all the time

this product lasted me   whole months i love it carmex is the best product ever  everything they make is worth purchasing and using helps the lips to blend in and moisture              great stuff for winter months love it works wonders love it was so happy a good chorizo should color your cooking oil red when fried in a pan  this chorizo does not  don quijote is much better but more expensive and getting harder to find  what a shame that we cannot buy a good chorizo here in the united states anymore its ok but i like a more roboust red wine for cooking i ve been dreaming of making a red wine reduction for years  finally did it for valentines for my then boyfriend  it was a hit  too bad he wasn t worth all that effort in the end  regardless  it was a perfect meal and this stuff helped make it so this is a good cooking wine unless you want to save it in the refrigerator  in a few days  it loses its taste have bought an eight pack of white grape juice to have on hand instead of getting this again i think it was great with prirmerib nothing wrong with goya cooking wine  it s great  what s wrong here is the price  i can buy this exact product at my supermarket for  as advertised great cooking what we needed wonderful  we moved to a small town and i could no longer buy goya cooking wines locally  love the wine for cooking and the larger bottles are far more affordable than buying multiple smaller bottles of other brands  wish i had thought of amazon months ago i was a big balsamic fan but this is now my go to for salad dressing this item is available in the mt prospect  il store it is not out of stock  the fillets are extra firm and do not fall apart like some other varieties i have bought  i like the flavor of the fillets  i have bought the bar harbor fillets in wine sauce and did not care them it says a discount for   bottles  then even shows reduced price but when you check out price changes tastes is so good this has got to be one of the best cabinet i have ever had great taste crisp i originally bought three bottles i wound up buying a whole case just for the holidays this cab is fantastic  i was pleasantly  surprised  great full bodied flavor  with   cent shipping promotion  the price is decent bought this red wine  for me  my holiday present  i love the crush version of apothic s red blend  super flavor  it was less expensive to have   bottles shipped to me then to buy them at the local store very nice wine   a little lighter than there other reds it is a not dry  very smooth  so you can taste the berry and cherry very well  says it has communion and caramel in it but i couldn t taste either  it is so good  i got a buzz after one glass  it is   so if you drink slow  you should be fine  i do not care for too sweet or dry  this makes this blend perfect i have been drinking this apothic california crush for the past six months and find it totally refreshing  it is so smooth and flavorable  one bottle is usually not enough and i tend to buy six bottles at a time  fortunately the price in alaska is much cheaper which makes it even more desirable this ointment works fine for dry eye  my only downfall is that it has a metal tip applicator  if it were plastic like the other similar products then i would give it   stars i stumbled across this a few years ago  and now it s all we use when we can buy it  great on hot dogs  brats  and the like  it s great to find out that we can order for store pick up at walmart  we would highly recommend to anyone that likes a little more kick than normal yellow mustard  to be clear  it is not too spicy at all  we think it is outstanding awesome mustard  i ve been using this brand for several years on german brats i get from a little place in wisconsin  this review was collected as part of a promotion silver springs has the best spicy mustard ever  can t find it locally anymore   and the value was great  no better tasting mustard on a brat i brought the rose  and cab  i just opened the rose  and it was just as advertised   not too sweet  that s the reason i don t drink rose s they are either too dry or too sweet  however  this was mildly sweet and not dry at all and very smooth  getting ready to do auto ship  i m a wine snob and yet i would serve this to a group and my personal wine connoisseur i purchased the   bottle harvest collection several weeks ago at the insane low price of   i tried the pinot noir last night and it was fantastic  i am looking forward to giving most away as gifts for the upcoming holiday season  you cannot go wrong with these wines  have a great day everyone really good wine and i have already ordered again perfect gift for my father for the holidays  been a family favorite for a long time i have never been so happy to receive a package as i was to receive the sampler pack from barefoot wine  it was an extremely busy time and i needed a boost  the package was delivered as promised and as described and was chilled  i will purchase again i like some of these but others had strange tastes  my favorite which is not in this mix  is the sweet red blend think this was a good purchase although i had nary a drop   must have been a very good choice too  because it s on a list to be ordered again i ve purchased barefoot cellars many times and this sampler was a great buy  the price was perfect and getting a chance to sample a little bit of everything is even better  my package came boxed very well and in my set i received a bottle of pinot grigio champagne  saving for special occasion  i had a glass of the chardonnay last night with dinner and it was so refreshing  i ve had a variety of whites and have tried to find something that i could have with a nice meal or alone  i am not a fan of white wines  but this one was perfect  definitely could have a glass of this alone while reading a good book getting christmas presents to friends and family in the usa  from the uk  can be frustrating  established gift companies often charge over the odds for the items they sell  but this barefoot cellars sampler case is great value  and we re told that it tasted great  a nice easy transaction and secure delivery  just as promised  made for satisfying gifting to old friends  many thanks so great to be able to share barefoot wine with friends and family around the country  especially those who are new to wine and don t know which varietal they truly love  iworkhere i love the fact that i can now buy barefoot wine for my out of state friends and ship it directly to their house  iworkhere i really like the foot as a logo  the wine is good but that little foot  sooo cute  and its even on the corks  which weirdly i do save  thinking of making art out of them  i am an artist and would love to design something for wine bottles    maybe i better go have another glass now  thank you barerfoot cellars wine from amazon what s not to love taste of the selected wine was quite pleasing  it came with suggestions for paring with food  i was not disappointed smooth full bodied wines at a fair price gift for my almost  i hope  daughter in law  she was very happy i enjoyed reading the wine label and descriptions on the back of the bottle as much as drinking this wine  my favorite line was something about the mission of the company to save marriages this package arrived when they said it would   it was also packed beautifully   nothing broken i m not a red wine person  but even the pinot noir was superb  wish it was sold locally  but i would definitely order again we really enjoy this wine and the name is very unique  great for gifts  outstanding taste  would definitely recommend and purchase again  thanks just as david the host said the cab was awesome  not dry at all and nice body in the glass  i m going back for more i got the rose  very good  not too sweet but mellow  i m not a big wine drinker  it this is the best i drank in a long time  i m going to order more  i should have ordered with tsv i bought the rose as they said it was sweetit turned out to be tasteless and really dry  nasty also took over a week to get herei am tired of how long it takes packages to arrive i have purchased this wine with various cheaper brands and have liked it far more  seemed very sour to me  not mellow at all  plus  they did not mention that you need to sign for this wine during the presentation  just they now deliver to pa  i found this out while tracking   my luck i was home the day of delivery  will go to the local state store for my regular brand i was so happy to see rose lincluded in this set instead of sweet zinfandel  unfortunately this rose was sweeter than zinfandel  very disappointed this wine is not great  in my opinion  i know wine taste is subjective  and this is only my opinion  but to me the wines are harsh  not smooth  an   taste  not   like hosts claimed  i ll drink it  will not gift it as i had hoped to  and have cancelled my auto delivery  i bought the mixed box so i ve tried them all wish this could be a positive review but not this time found the reds to be lacking greatly in aroma  nose  and both with an unpleasant finish usually we have been pleased overall with the wines but this is a definite miss for us we love the onehope reds and are so excited to see the new labels  the pinot is perfect for this time of year  the cab and merlot are our year round go to s with dinner  cannot wait for the ups guy to role up drinking wine with a purpose i have tried the cabernet and the merlot  when i received these i followed the suggestion of letting the wine sit from shipping  and then to open and let sit in order to breathe  i felt the cabernet was still to young  it had a very strong bite to it  i don t consider myself an expert  but i know a wine i like and have been taught a lot and am still learning  the merlot on the other hand was much better  it was smooth and had a deep fruit flavor with mild tannins  i would continue buying this one  i have not tried the pinot noir yet  i m hoping this will be just as satisfying as the merlot was  i will add to my review once i ve opened the bottle  and most of all i love how this company takes some of the proceeds and gives them to wonderful causes  that alone is worth buying this shipping was excellent and so was the wine  it s nice to be able to purchase a good product and donate to charity at the same time  this is our second time purchasing the wine onehope creates delicious wines that all support amazing causes  these reds are great for entertaining or relaxing after a long day  rich and flavorful  each of these reds has their own unique quality  personally the merlot is my favorite  being able to get all of these great wines together is a great deal  treat yourself to these reds or send them as a gift  you won t be disappointed i absolutely love the onehope reds and this mixed pack is such a great deal between the discount and   cent shipping  this is my go to gift for anyone i know who appreciates great wine  i ve been a fan of this winery for a long time and love the sleek new labels love the new labels and also love knowing that with every sip  we are making a social impact  this is a great gift to send to family and friends  spreading the word about great wines and awesome causes they support ordering this wine was the first time i had ever ordered wine online  and i wasn t sure if i would really like the wines or not  well i loved all of them  even though i am not a huge fan of pinot noirs  i really like that this company donates a percentage of each wine purchased to a different charity  the company is all about sustainability and giving back  one hope is a company with a cause  and outstanding wine  there is just so much to love about this wine i ve been following and drinking onehope wines for a while now  i love bringing these to parties and introducing all my friends to delicious wines that help support so many causes  the pinot for paws is my favorite i almost cant believe all of the good reviews for these wines  we pretty much couldn t even drink them because they are so sweet  thick and jammy  like fruit juice  we started with the pinot noir and after a few sips  aerating and then a few more sips with dinner  we just poured it out  it did not resemble any pinot i ve had before  so we moved on to the cabernet   and it was almost the same thing  i haven t tried the merlot yet but not looking forward to it  if i had bought these at a local shop they would be returned  unfortunately  i that s not an option since they are open and mail order  maybe the rest can be frozen for cooking  i do love that this producer gives back to charities  more companies should follow their lead in that respect wine by mail  and such good  full bodied reds  i will buy again but along the way  i need a new corkscrew  my serviceable current one struggles with the tight packed corks  makes sense who wants leaky wine and re corking is no cinch  either i have wandered among the corkscrews sold on amazon  and have no idea how to choose  if you have a suggrstion  please leave it in comments  thanks love love love this wine  my friend threw an event and used onehope and ever since i have been hooked  bought the   pack as a thank you gift and it was a huge hit  love the fact that this company donates   to good causes  takes the guilt out of drinking  ha love the new labels and also love knowing that with every sip  we are making a social impact  this is a great gift to send to family and friends  spreading the word about great wines and awesome causes they support this is my  nd purchase of the mixed pack  first purchase were given away as individual gifts  decided to taste for my self  i m a pinot cab fan  the pinot was a little on the light side for me but as someone mentioned earlier  open and let sit for a while  it s definitely better  the cab is my favorite and i would purchase again  i shared the merlot with a merlot fan and they liked it a lot  since part of the proceeds go to various charities its worth the purchase arrived promptly and well packed  nice selection of wines which tasted very good  will be using this often as gifts  by going through amazon smile we can contribute to our designated smile cause and also do some good through donations made by one hope  it s a real win win situation the merlot was harsh  it has my throat burning like moonshine  never tasted wine like this before  hope it is just a bad bottle one of my favorite big reds  jammy  fruit forward  lush  berries  not too sweet  for our taste  tannic  in a good way  i alternate at the moment on a daily basis between apothic dark and gnarly head authentic black  both selling for   at ralphs   why would anyone buy online and pay double wow  i wanted a different kind of wine to serve to friends  unfortunately  for them  i opened the bottle of apothic dark before anyone arrived so i could taste it  by the time they showed up  there wasn t much of the apothic left to share  oops  they got the regular wine  this is now by far my favorite wine  by the way  if you like a sweet tickle pink kind of wine  this one is not for you i am not a fan of red wines  but i study nutrition and am learning about the health benefits of dark red wines  i got this at trader joe s with fingers crossed  when i opened the bottle  it smelled like espresso at breakfast  i found that odd  but i love coffee  so it gave me hope that i would like it  sipping this delicious beverage was like warm berries on a summer day  this wine is straight up comfort food  sublimely satisfying if you like blends  this is very good this is currently one of our favorite wines  we ve even recommended it to friends  it s moderately sweet without to much dryness at the end  the cork is actually black  which we thought was a nice touch love this deep rich but not sweet wine  my first taste was few months ago while visiting relatives in copperhill  tennessee  i was surprised with the wonderful  smooth taste and flavors  and happy to learn it was a california wine  upon returning to calfornia i ordered a case and shared this delicious hearty smooth wine with friends  apothic also makes a red wine that is not dark  it to is a smooth flavorful wine but not as rich and deep as the dark  it goes great with everything or nothing  enjoy  christina based on reading some of the reviews here  i considered canceling my order  i m very glad i did not  i just received my first shipment  and i have to say i am really enjoying this cabernet sauvignon  i m very glad i signed up for auto ship i realize this is an inexpensive bottle of wine but it is tasteless  will not buy wine from qvc again this is one of the best chards that i have had in a long time  very light and delicious  i have ordered another wine from qvc and this is the best yet  i am on automated ordering and i also changed it to every   days  you will not be disappointed i m not a wine expert  i m a novice  but this wine is delicious  so glad i ordered autoship wine was delicious  best buy ever we ve always had good luck with smoking loon and these wines were no exception  very flavorful this whole order was a nightmare from day one  after almost   weeks it came i wish it didn t i gifted   bottles to my son   when he sent me a text how awful it was   that he dumped it down the drain i was horrified to say the least  luckily it was my son because i bought these for holiday gifts  qvc needs more quality control for items like this we work hard for our money   spending it on something i will be dumping down the drain is not acceptable i was refunded my money but it still is very upsetting that this vintage wine estates sells such garbage to a reputable company like qvc i have tried the cab and it is acceptable for what i wanted   an after work glass of wine  put the pinot away as it is way too young to drink  the rose was refreshing  i have not tried the chardonnay yet  this group of wines worked for me in that   it was about the price of grocery store wine    it was delivered to my house  and   i get to try a variety of wines that i normally would not purchase  i marked that i would not recommend this as a gift only because everyone s palate is different   i do not usually give wine as a gift i have been waiting for this bundle  as the presentation indicated the rose is not that over bearing sweet  just in the middle and therefore i can enjoy it also  along with the delicious pino noir my favorite and the chardonnay  these are delicious with a meal  by themselves or with cheese   as david says  everything is better with cheese  i have on auto  delivery  i wish i could pre order for next year too  very smooth wine  everything they said in the presentation with david and other hosts are spot on  i am enjoying this bundle and you will too  thank you qvc and vintage wine estates  sincerely i bought   of the wine collections  one in the mixed of white   red and one in the all reds  the only one we thought was somewhat decent was the chardonnay  the funny thing is  we aren t even chardonnay drinkers  we both thought that one was the only consumable wine  still bad but the best of the whole lot of wines  rose was the next best but very tart  pulling slightly sour and not in a good way  both the pinot   cab sauv were very sour  almost like corked wine tastes  it burned when you drank it  like you were drinking straight rubbing alcohol  gross  we brought them to the correct temp  let them breathe  etc  but they are just straight up nasty  was a big disappointment as we were really looking forward to getting them and being on auto delivery  i m giving   stars since the packaging of wine in the boxes   the shipping was great as well as qvc customer service  i called   explained everything to qvc and immediately received a refund  no hassles  questions  etc  just immediately refunded the   payments i already made  while the wines disappointed  qvc did not  thank you qvc  this is exactly why i will remain a loyal shopper i consider myself a wine lover but i m not a wine snob  i decided to finally order wine from qvc and went for the mixed case as i do like reds and whites  after trying each variety  i regret the decision  while not horrible  they aren t good either  these aren t wines i d serve to anyone or drink again let alone purchase again  the ros  is a sweet wine no doubt about it  which isn t my taste  but it was described as being not too sweet  the chardonnay is the strangest tasting chardonnay i ve ever tasted  it was described as not being too oaky  i guess i like my chardonnay oaky  and the pinot noir  which the  wine expert  repeatedly mispronounced  red flag  was just bland  the cabernet sauvingnon was supposed to be the best of the bunch and it was private reserve after all but just turned out to be disappointing as well  these wines were touted as having a retail value of   per bottle but taste more like sub   per bottle  which is exactly how much it works out to when you buy the case  you get what you pay for  as they say  and if something sounds too good to be true  it probably is  lessons learned in this case got this for the nice variety it offered  rose is nice  not too sweet not too dry  pinot noir is average  nothing special or outstanding and i wouldn t get it again  chardonnay is awful  maybe just the bottle we opened  but it immediately smelled spoiled and tasted the same  wound up pouring it down the drain and hoping the next two bottles aren t rotten as well  have not tried the cab yet as it s my favorite type of wine and i hate to be disappointed hoping we ll be two for four at least  sorry to say next time i ll pass we are still sampling each one   so far favorite is the chardonnay  but that can change i just received my collection  i opened the rose and it was very tasty  this rose is not overly sweet and that was my main concern  it has a light fruity taste and pairs well with cheeses  i haven t tasted the others yet  but this is a great deal for the quantity you receive  i will continue to update as i open the others this whole order was a nightmare from day one  after almost   weeks it came i wish it didn t i gifted   bottles to my son   when he sent me a text how awful it was   that he dumped it down the drain i was horrified to say the least  luckily it was my son because i bought these for holiday gifts  qvc needs more quality control for items like this we work hard for our money   spending it on something

for four at least  sorry to say next time i ll pass i love the size and the price on this cooler  however the lower quality than brand name coolers is evident in the finish on this cooler  after about   weeks of use the rope handle pulled loose while lifting and the cooler fell to the ground but survived the fall  trademark innovations  please send me new plastic handles i bought a case of his reds   from qvc right before christmas  i was extremely disappointed with my purchase as were my dinner guests  it is always better to sample a wine before making a purchasing  a lesson learned never ordered wine thru mail but so glad i did  i was pleasantly surprised   i will be ordering again this wine is quite good and i am glad i have this on auto delivery  it is robust and smooth  if you enjoy red wine  this ones for you i like full bodied but smooth red  the meritage is a perfect blend of the things i love in red wine  have alternated lately between a pinot noir and cab  this is delicious and perfectly priced i knew that kevin o leary loved good wine  well  let me tell you  he also makes some delicious wine  i purchased the  bottle chardonnay and it is wonderful  i m no wine expert  but i know what i like  i enjoy white wine but i don t like sweet  which is why i didn t try the moscato  i like to enjoy a nice glass of white wine whenever i feel like it  this wine is delightful by the glass   no food necessary  i m very pleased with my purchase and even more pleased that i purchased it on auto delivery  i can t wait for my next shipment  i highly recommend this wine  mr  wonderful will not let you down i have ordered wines from o leary before  i love red wine  but this red wine is awesome  more smooth than cabernet  and cab is usually my first choice  that was ok but this this this one   auto delivery for sure bought the wine for my son for a christmas present  was very skeptical at first  first  i myself really don t care for wine  leaves a nasty after taste and bitter to me  plus after drinking   glass of red  i wake up with a severe headache  well anyway my son open a bottle  i had ordered all red  i went over to see if i could with stand the smell  totally surprised i could  so i decided to try it  very smooth  no after taste  not a strong  bitter smell  had guests over for new year s eve and they had enjoyed it just as much as i did and my son  probably will be ordering again disappointed with the taste and consistency of these wines  my husband and i were looking forward to sharing them with friends on christmas eve  we tried the four variety to be fair and were not satisfied planning to send the rest back i too was skeptical on ordering wines on line  i figured meh  i love wine how bad could it be  i was surprised  very smooth  flavorful with a beautiful nose i was a little skeptical about purchasing wine from qvc  but i ve been very surprised by the quality of this wine collection  i ordered the mixed auto delivery package  the moscato was indeed sweet  just like you d expect from a moscato  and the syrah was not too bad  i guess i should have said from the outset that i m a sweet wine drinker  i like sweet red wines  so the red was not to my liking because it was too dry  i never drink chardonnay because they are likewise too dry for me  but  kevin o leary s chardonnay is my favorite from the entire order  it is awesome  magnificent  and very tasty  i even ordered some fettuccine just so i could pair it with the chardonnay  great find  for me  i m so glad i ordered the auto delivery because i can t wait to see what i get in the spring  very good wine  mr  o leary i belong to other clubs but bought this because of the free shipping  i do not like rose wine and was sure i d hate it but it is excellent  a slight sweet taste very slight  it is a little effervescent too  i forgot where i bought it and googled it to buy more   it runs   for   bottles  not expensive but not   a bottle either  i have not had the others but i am anxious to taste them you get what you pay for  i got it for   a bottle and that s about all it is worth  i should of known better  but it s free s h  i was disappointed it s all from the same vintner and not as the labels show different wineries  it was just the ease of delivery  i live in california and have so many options of good wines  one and only purchase  q does not know good wines we had four friends over tonight for dinner  they loved this wine  hands down the mascato was the favorite  there were no complaints about the chardonnay at all but the first choice was the mascato  they were very excited to find out that more was on the way with auto delivery my kids love them  so no complaints but i m sure they are not healthy of course easy and quick to serve  brings a smile to their faces  pretty good value for a quick drink product worked great kids loved them walmart used to carry a swiss water decaf coffee that had excellent flavor  i ve been looking for a replacement since they quit selling it in the store so and purchased this coffee  though i liked the flavor of the sam s coffee a bit better  this coffee is pretty good as well  it has a fine ground and medium dark roast great decaf coffee using swiss water process  i won t buy anything that is decaf using traditional methods good stuff  really it is real good for the price and i will reorder from this vendor these wines were a happy surprise  i bought an assortment of wines for a house warming party last weekend and these were great  white cat was like a sweet mascoto  cabin fever had a sweet taste all it own  i red cat was also sweet  i don t care for red wine but this was good  the breathable berry reminded me of a sangria this brand is on the top of my list  i will buy more of their wines excellent wines and customer service  i sent them as a gift and they loved it all arrived safe and sound  only tried one bottle so far  mighty tasty absolutely delicious  it was the perfect holiday gift  my in laws loved it great wine and price loved every bottle  will order again red cat is my favorite wine of all time the red cat itself is sweet but not too much so  with a little tartness the white cat is light and refreshing especially ice cold  same goes with the cabin fever the best out of the   in my opinion though is bramble berry  tart  sweet and tastes like berry jam  i love it nicely done  wine tastes good and the chocolate that comes in the packing is delicious  they could have however printed the brand name in a smaller font on the glass  the current font size is too large to be used when inviting guests i had to chase down delivery since you have to sign for it  not an issue  the gift set was beautiful and a lot for the price  i purchase this for my boss who is leaving the company  she loved it  i would buy this again definitely  naked winery just gained a new customer naked cab is by far one of my favorite red wines out there  woody with depth and complexity and notes of black currant  this is one fabulous wine  i love that this gift set is all inclusive   a big dark chocolate bar and   very nice wine glasses  your recipient will think you spent a fortune on this gift box  comes very nicely packaged in a black box  festive crinkle and tissue paper fill and fun things like a bumper sticker and tattoos  great buy  love this set i purchased two of these as holiday gifts  the price seemed just right for a bottle of wine  glasses and chocolate  in fact  even without glasses  this would ve been a good value to ship across country  i was skeptical about how nicely the presentation would look in person but the recipients sent a picture and i was floored  it looks gorgeous  and expensive  i can t speak to the quality of the wine  but as far as the overall gift  i am pleased that the recipients are pleased and would purchase again  however  as another reviewer noted and that i did not read before purchasing  there was some risqu little cards included in the gift box that boldly stated let s get naked referring i m sure to the name of the winery  and also i truly did not even notice the silhouettes of women on the glasses or the tag line we aim to tease on the glasses  which is my fault  but i have to say i did not like that  i feel a bit embarrassed now as i hope the recipients don t confuse my intentions  fortunately these gifts went to couples with a sense of humor about it but had i sent this to someone more conservative in my life  i would have been so very  very embarrassed cabernet and chocolate  win win  this wine is such an easy drinking cab that it is hard not to buy it any time it s available  let alone when it is on special  combine it with glasses and some chocolate my date night is made this wine is the best cab for the money i ve ever had  sometimes a   cab tastes like a   cab  and that s a bargain wine for sure  this washington cabernet sauvignon from naked winery drinks like a   cabernet  so try it now  this is not a fruity oak bomb  nor a lengthy  earthy  subtle cab here are my  liner tasting notes black currant and dark cherry on the nose lead to hints of clove and praline on the palate  medium tannins  an elegant  smoky barrel toast on the finish bought this for my daughter in law  she loved it bought this for sis in law s birthday  love the winery i will never order again   two buck chuck  has better taste the wine was excellent ordered the moscato  and auto delivery  second order i switched to white zinfandel it was delicious also we ordered   bottles of the moscato on auto delivery  so glad we did  it s different but we love it very good  nice flavor  receiving reds on auto delivery i am originally from france love red wine i didn t think i will love it but as a surprise  it s a great wine for the price i recommend you gave kevin s wine a try delivery was a little slow but it was worth the wait  i was very pleased with the moscato selection  it arrived in excellent condition  which indicates it was well packaged  the price was very reasonable i have tried this wine before  but this batch was not good at all and i will never order again knowing that wine taste varies  have to say i really enjoy the moscato  i find it very refreshing  with a great flavor  i chose the auto delivery  and share with my sister  who also enjoys and looks forward to when the next delivery is due i ve only tried the chardonnay  so my review is for that wine  i find it very good when chilled properly  i take it out of the refrigerator an hour before drinking it   it s perfect  it s not to cold or warm  when drunk too cold  it doesn t have much taste  at the proper temp  it becomes much more complex  it has a clean delicate taste of peach   apricot  it s not a heavy chardonnay  no oak  butter or vanilla undertone  i prefer this crisper  fresher chardonnay  the heavy ones make me gag don t know why others have given such bad reviews  i guess each person has their own taste but i love the moscato   my family   friends also enjoy it i m not a wine drinker but have relatives and friends who are  so i purchased   bottles to have on hand at home and also for gifts  my brother visited this weekend and i opened the red wine for him to enjoy during a football game  he tried to be gracious but finally said it just wasn t good  now i m wondering what the people thought who received wine as gifts  i have eight bottles left and wondering if i should just pour them down the drain  what a disappointment after the hosts all ooo ed and ahhh ed over this supposedly fabulous wine assortment i have order three cases over past two years a great wine for the price point  other reviews i have read judge this to harshly  including shipping it is a twelve dollar a bottle wine  i have order many wines for an average of   a bottle and not nearly as good    i order   cases of wine a least every year  this is a great value in the price range it sells for i am not a wine expert  but i am italian and like wine  i ordered the white selection and i absolutely love it  i enjoy a glass of wine without the meal attached  my first time ordering moscato and it is delicious  next favorite is the white zinfandel  the chardonnay is also very good  kevin did an excellent job mixing the favors  i am on auto delivery so i am able to give them as nice gifts  but not the moscato we ordered   white and   red twice  really like them  sweet is not a favorite  but it was good thought this would be a good sampler of wine at a very decent price  the mixed case has some wine that friends liked  some i liked  but overall the case is just non descript  chardonnay was very light on the oaky taste  other whites were ok  meritage is ok  pinot noir was unidentifiable as such  cab sauv  ok  white zin  no one wanted it  so i can t say this was a  wonderful  assortment  i have cancelled the remainder of the auto ship  thanks anyway  kevin  i ll pick my own bottles locally not the quality at all that i was expecting from kevin o leary  very disappointed  and i would not serve this to guests definitely not worth the hassle  don t waste your time or your money the cab was the only drinkable one  using for cooking wine  for that reason  mr wonderful  i m out first  before i purchase a wine for a second time i need to sample it  not possible this way of course so i relied on qvc and kevin o leary s reputation for making my purchase so far i have been very pleased with the quality and taste of each of the reds in the collection  a great value for the quality and proud to serve it to guests  look forward to next auto ship and purchasing the white collection love love love kevin s reserve wines  just the best   th or  th time ordering and will continue to order more and auto delivery  fantastic deal on really great wine  can t go wrong  a no brainer  if you love wine do it had this wine for a few months and finally got around to tasting we ordered the   bottle sampler set and we are loving the chardonnay and the syrah cannot wait to taste the others will order again i m not a wine snob but i ve had my fair share of wine over the years  i taste new brands fairly regularly  you can do much better at your local store for the same or less money  basically tastes like a good box wine  black box   etc the cabernet is a true value  the chardonnay is also great we have ordered both white and red sets of o leary wines more than once  and we have had consistently excellent wine with every single bottle the sweet wines are delicate and blended perfectly without being too sweet  the rich reds are deep without being too tannic or biting  when we need a wine we can count on to be perfect for guests  or gifts or just enjoying with our everyday meals  this is our go to wine we recommend it highly i purchased these to give as gifts last year and when i tried the wine myself i spit it out and was mortified i was so embarrassed that i gave these wines to people i know that i had to apologize and give another gift this is by far some of the worst swill i ve ever had there are wines that are the same price from california wineries that are far superior i would not even cook with this stuff i wish i had discovered the poor quality and the offensive taste during the return period because they would have gone back  this is what they had in mind when they coined the expression  rot gut if you re a selective wine drinker  don t buy this  it s mediocre at best  will likely end up using for cooking i wish i had returned this wine  but only gradually used and each bottle was less than satisfying  have ordered vintage wine estates wine a few times before and very much enjoyed  o lerary s reserve wines were not of the same quality in my opinion and in the opinion of my book club members  not sure if they were left in the heat somewhere along the way or just what  but just no happy with these and would not order again  kevin presents himself as quite the wine producer and he is likely quite knowledgeable  but there is better wine available at lower cost purchased on auto delivery  first shipment great  second came with   bottle of sav but no moscato  we do not like the sav but are now stuck with all these bottles  third shipment came with the moscato and   more sav  shipped well before they said it would or at least they said in process so we could not delay or skip shipment  moscato is great others are ok  trying to cancel balance and would order the moscato and other whites but price with shipping even  included  makes it costly  disappointed i m really picky about wine  to be honest  i ve had cheap wine that is good and more expensive wine that is not good  a good wine to me has a good balance  i actually really really liked the moscato  moscato is my favorite type of wine and i ve had a lot that i don t care for  if you like bartenura  you will appreciate this  i liked the white zin also  i didn t care for the chardonnay  but my husband said it was  ok  i d like to get the   bottle pack that you can choose  but the current price makes the   bottle pack more expensive per bottle  i d say all in all  this is a decent middle of the road group of wines  the moscato impressed me the most  for those who haven t heard of the bartenura comparison  it s a   bottle  so it puts it right in about the same class as o leary  if you re curious about this  if say take a chance  regardless how i feel about the taste of the chardonnay  they are all quite fragrant which i enjoy i purchased the   bottle mixed package to sample something new to me in the rose and meritage  i usually drink pinot noir and chardonnay or pinot grigio  i wish the wines lived up to their descriptions  but sadly they did not  i realize tastes are subjective  but for me  the chardonnay was very tart and without any full taste  i would not order these again i am a pinot noir wine drinker generally  but the pinot noir in this case is terrible  even after decanting  have tried two of the pinot bottles and a few of each of the others  i actually prefer the cab over anything in the case and i usually don t like cabs can t believe that i was so stupid to fall for kevin o leary s promotion of his wines  i believed in him  and therefore went ahead and purchased the variety dozen bottles  what a fool i have been  i wanted to give him the benefit of doubt  but i continue to be disappointed  yes  i know i have a month to return the merchandise  what a laugh  how to return a huge package  i poured most in the kitchen sink  live and learn i purchased these to give as gifts last year and when i tried the wine myself i spit it out and was mortified i was so embarrassed that i gave these wines to people i know that i had to apologize and give another gift this is by far some of the worst swill i ve ever had there are wines that are the same price from california wineries that are far superior i would not even cook with this stuff i wish i had discovered the poor quality and the offensive taste during the return period because they would have gone back  this is what they had in mind when they coined the expression  rot gut i am more of a dry wine person  but i have enjoyed the chardoney and rose  not to sweet  not to dry  great gifts my friends said they enjoyed i was really hopeful that i would experience a new tasting wine just because it s  mr  wonderful s  brand  however it was not as flavorful as what i had become accustomed  it s not bad it s just okay  i purchased the zinfandel  i wanted the moscato but it had sold out  i still may go back later and purchase it because it might be exactly what i m looking to purchase  i would still recommend this product because everyone has a different expectation when it comes to wine tasting i purchased the pinot noir and it was terrible  dumping it and won t purchase again  i only like sweet  not super sweet  wine and the moscato is absolutely delicious  i m not one to drink it with the suggested food pairings  i ll have it with anything because it tastes that good  like it before  during  or after dinner  it just tastes great  this is really good wine and the price is good too this is the best vine i have ever tasted  i had to reorder me a second round very unique tast i love it you won t go wrong with this i have ordered the set of   in the past  i have tried them all and enjoyed allhowever white zinfandel is my favorite  i have given them as gifts with no complaints just compliments  soooo smooth i only like a sweet wine  i was skeptical on ordering without tasting it first  i am so glad i ordered it  i love it  thanks kevin o leary i ordered a   bottle set of both the meritage   moscata wines for friends who did me a huge favor and most definitely know their wines  they called me to say they thought these were both the best they had tasted in awhile   said they were thoroughly enjoying them and when they finished this set planned to order these   bottle sets on their own as they want to try all varieties   thanks kevin   qvc for a hit  i ordered the white zinfadel in the   bottle selection which arrived on friday  this wine is absolutely one of the best i have ever had the pleasure of tasting  my husband and i visited nappa wine valley and sonoma wineries about   years ago  our hats off to mr  kevin o leary to bring such a joy  a truly inspired new one which can certainly hold it s own  we had company yesterday and everyone remarked as to how well it is done  thank you so much for this wonderful offering this was my first purchase of these wines  tried the moscato as i like a sweet wine  found it to be the best i ve ever had  the only drawback to ordering wine on line is having to be home for the delivery  missed the ups guy a couple times i don t know why the negative reviews said the wine tasted horrible  i should have ordered a case  mr  wonderful  you have not promised what you haven t delivered  fold with this wine  i ought to go on auto ship with the case'"

       "'this a fantastic white wine for any occasion tart  not sweet very refreshing and delicious i was given this wine so it was a delightful surprise to find that it has a flavorful and delicious taste  a new favorite this is a phenomenal wine and my new favorite red   ml bottles for the price of two with way less packaging yes please  i was nervous it was too good to be true and i wouldn t like the wine but it s fantastic  i have to go a bit out of my way to get it  i live near a state line and it isn t sold in my state due to liquor laws  but it s worth it i love becks na  it tastes just like a regular ale  it smells like one too  it tastes great  it s the only na that i drink  my friends love it too  it has a great head when you pour this wine has a wonderful but strong aroma its a bit bitter has a bite to it but still goodit was worth it in the end i would give one more star if it came clean on the bottle and called itself a  sweet red  instead it get s poetic and grandiose about itself when all it is is a blend which  standard practice  gets a dash of grape juice concentrate to sweeten it  it also looses a star for the price  i rather look to the side of my target s shelves and pick up a lambrusco for about   less delicious and very affordable this is a very smooth red with aromas of cocoa  coffee  tobacco sweet black cherry  bold but soft  i highly recommend this one based on positive reviews  i served all of the fancy pants varieties at a recent party  my guests and i loved them  since i am not a wine expert  i will provide some details on this variety from the fancy pants website   is like sunshine in the glass  its brisk and bright  with inviting citrus  melon and passion fruit aromas leading to mouthwatering grapefruit and zesty lime flavors with hints of minerality on the palate  vibrant acidity and a crisp  clean finish make this wine a versatile partner for a wide range of foodsespecially succulent seafood  mediterranean style grilled vegetables  and salads  served well chilled  our sauvignon blanc is fun and friendlythe perfect pour for sunny afternoons and picnics nice fruity and sweet taking sparkling wine  goes great in mimosa  you have to try it to see how you will like it  even the guys would enjoy this at your wedding a rich amber ale with a subtle but noticeable hop character  great beer to pair with food this light bodied ipa is dry hopped with cascade for a bold and bright hp aroma  balanced by a refreshing and crisp ale  great for a cookout out day at the beach  love it this light bodied ipa is dry hopped with cascade for a bold and bright hp aroma  balanced by a refreshing and crisp ale  great for a cookout out day at the beach  love it great for a perfect summer day or a get together with the girls i m not sure if this is a bad bottle or if it was intentionally made effervescent  i don t want bubbles when i drink pinot grigio  goes well with mozzarella string cheese and cinemasins obsessed with this new drink however  it has been sold out at every target i have been to lately  this is an excellent red wine  not to dry and not real sweet  more of a red blend  great go with anything anytime  in the right price point as other known brands on the market one of the best cabernets i had in quite sometime this is a great buy for the price  someone had given me a bottle and i liked the look of it so much that i didn t want to open it  had no idea it was so nicely priced and so easily available  finally opened it when i was in a bind  needing white wine for a favorite holiday recipe and this was all i had on hand  it s a nice  smooth pinot  very nice flavor  pleasurable to the palate  what i especially love about this brand  however  is the bottle itself  screw off the black top and there is a smaller neck with a cork closure  the beauty is that the black cap is designed so that it will reseal the bottle without the cork needing to be squeezed back in a really thoughtful design  i almost hate to admit how much i was impressed by it  will be stopping by target specifically to buy more to have in the house  highly recommend gluten free plus lower on calories plus very refreshing best of the bunch of all of the wine cube sku s  target wine buyer  please bring back i like the wine and i like the idea of a sealed cube during the week when only drinking a glass or two at a time  but when they re sized the box a few months ago  it made it impossible to open and setup properly  while i applaud target for reducing the packaging  this just isn t working i have tried my share of moscato d  astis before  this has to be the smoothest that i have ever tried  not too sweet or too fizzy but perfect  i got it for the pretty bottle but was very surprised about the taste  try it  you won t be disappointed highly  highly recommend  it s sweet but not syrupy  just right  and i love that it s bubbly  i don t have to mix my wine with seltzer anymore my favorite bottle design  the best cheap lager delicious  i hate all the other flavors but this one tastes great  now if i can only find it in the store this wine is amazing  i m an avid wine drinker  mom life  and i ll continue to buy this for sure  for   it s a steal  keep this around please  it s just another reason to love target love it that it s not too dry or overly sweet  also has a good balance of alcohol this wine was sooooo good  i usually don t like cabernet but this special fermented wine is very tasty  it did not stay around too long lol some of the best boxed wine i have ever tasted  great taste and great value love this moscato and will be purchasing more on my next target run  let it chill in the fridge and enjoy on a hot summer day had my sissies  sistafriends  over for dinner planning meeting and they re still talking about the loving fellowship and the great wine  i hope the store has more than   bottle left on its shelves great fruity dry rose is this the greatest wine in the world  of course not  it is an eminently drinkable wine as a matter of fact it is my preferred  and go to  table wine  wine is a personal thing but for me it is my   pick in the under   category  it is well balanced  subtle  and very easy to sip  dry without being overpowering  it is not a big bad cabernet but it is not that in a good way  goes great by itself or paired with cheese or a dish sauced with something heavier like a bernaise  i always have a bottle on my shelf delicious white wine  light  crisp  not too sweet  almost too good just bad wine  the worst i have ever had  try bota box sarah is you are looking for a decent boxed wine i am no wine expert by any means  but i love a good red for dinner or a cold night  this is the ticket  rich  dark  fruity  just lovely  the hubby liked it too best wine i ever tasted not fruity  very satisfying  my go to chardonnay  excellent product   would expect to pay     bottle for this quality picked some up on a trip to the beach as they are portable non breakable and priced right  i didn t know what to expect  honestly  my expectations were not too high  being boxed wine and all  i was pleasantly surprised  it is very drinkable delicious  when i got home i returned to target to get the large wine cube box for at home enjoyment by far the best boxed wine i ve found  and comparable to medium priced bottled sauvignon blancs  a great buy by far the best boxed wine i ve found  and comparable to medium priced bottled sauvignon blancs  a great buy taste was absolutely fine for a   chardonnay  however  both bottles broke while removing the corkscrew  second break was far enough i didn t want to risk drinking it because of risk of glass shards  i ve bought cheaper wines like yellowtail  etc  and never experienced a bottle breaking i didnt find this to be sweet at all  but everyones taste differs  i usually dont like sweet wines so i gravitate towards chardonnay and some sauvignon blancs and i felt like this one had more of a buttery taste than a sweet citrusy taste like another reviewer stated  for the price  this is definitely a keeper my boyfriend brought this home on a whim  we were delighted at how tasty it was  lasted us a couple weeks   even better i love disaronno  it has a smooth texture and the flavor is lightly sweet  it s decadent on the rocks or with a little cream i m surprised how good this is for the price  tastes more like sauvignon blanc to me nice  light wine   i was not sure what to expect but was surprised how well it tasted for a   bottle for as much as we drink white wine  i needed to find a budget bottle  we d been doing   dollar bottles  but this beats that  and it s pretty good  you won t impress anyone with this  but for a monday thursday  home and on a budget drinking  this is good i served this and all the different varieties at a party  my guests and i loved them all  since i am not a wine expert  i will simply give you some of the notes on this variety from the fancy pants website   a robust and rich palate with ripe berries  red fruit  and toasty oak flavors  cherries and vanilla spice on the mouth lead to a long  lingering finish i tried beringer  who makes this  pink moscato  had no trouble opening it up with a corkscrew  one which i just bought from target in store  really like its sweet  fruity flavor pink looking wine  i plan to stock up for the holidays if you like a fruit forward blend of reds with a very smooth finish and jammy taste  you will love this  i think my   year search for my favorite red wine has ended this is a dry rose  not sweet at all which is perfect for summer a wonderful dry wine  and the taste is just divine a wonderful dry wine  and the taste is just divine been looking for strongbow in the us for years refreshing  nice grapefruit flavor  not for people that dislike seltzer water  it s good out of the can or poured over ice it is not sweet and i like that  if you like the taste of sparkling water with the benefit of   alcohol  this is for you best cabernet i ve ever tasted  simple as that so refreshing  loveit this cayman jack margarita is really good  i found it in a southern california target  but i can t find it in northern california stores   i expected this beer to be on the bitter side the first time i tried it  but i still enjoyed its smooth taste  i d definitely buy it if i get a chance looked like a linear regulator from outside and no reviews on it so i ordered this puppy to put it to the test  definitely a switcher and fairly quiet  well regulated just like all of rm italy products  great quality i love sparkling wine  but i find that most brands are sweet  i m aging and no longer want the sweet stufd  this is medium body wine with strong bubbles  i love bubbles     the alcohol content offers a nice buzz fairly quickly  so ecstatic i found this brand and target carries it i served this at my baby shower and everyone went crazy over it  it s an inexpensive gem this wine is full bodied and delicious super wine with fruity taste  as a regular wine drinker this is our routine wine of choice  priced right with good taste had a taste of either being old or spoiled  stick with the bottle this is our go to wine for dinner parties  better than most of the   bottles i have been enjoying jim beam original for many years  i started mixing jb o with slice while wife and i watched dallas  i have tried other whiskeys  but keep coming back to jb  now i enjoy it mixed with diet pepsi  since i can no longer find slice it goes great in apple cider consistent flavor and quality  jb with dr  pepper is surprisingly tasty  i highly recommend it  love your commercials  too  mila is doing you proud  keep up the good work a true classic of spirits i love this bourbon as it is always my first choice when its time to unwind  whether its neat  on rocks  with a coke or ginger ale  or my grandpa s whiskey sour  nothing tops jim beam  nothing the white label or the devil s cut dashed with some lemonade and lime cordial is how i enjoy my jim best drink you can get to make manhattens best bourbon i have found have toured distillery and love the brand red stag and coke zero is my go to drink  only wish more bars and restaurants stocked it  nothing like a good bourbon with a cherry kick  i like it with dr peper to sip and relax better than the other s drank it for years and always smooth and tasty  now it is running off the shelves at our liquor store i keep jim beam on hand every day of the week i typically have this neat or with an ice cube  its light amber appearance  sweet  woody  mossy nose  and its mild moss  white oak  mellow wintergreen mint  and dried  faintly candied fruit flavor draws the drinker into an exploration of pin point distilling execution  jim beam original has a gradual finish  with a ghost of chocolate powder  during the fade out  highly recommended  rjt it s does have a great toaste to it the only drink i ll drink i had a neat   finger glass two weeks ago of jb black label for the first time  i ve always drank jack daniels  and i loved it  no more jack for me best tasteing and defenetly the smoothest around i love it i always keep a bottle of jim bean in my liquor cabinet  value for price is incredible and it mixes great this is our favorite mixed drink whiskey and sams has the best price on a handle  we ll be buying this again best whiskey around and a price that can t be beat to make manhattens best bourbon i have found have toured distillery and love the brand i drink yellow tail because you can not buy a perfect wine for the price of this one  i just love it i always buy this item at walmart cause they always have it at a great price as a scotch drinker  tasting basil hayden s for the first time changed my opinion of bourbons  now i enjoy both scotch bourbon with bh on the top of list for bourbons very tasty bourbon basil hayden was my gateway to world of burbon  ever since i have held its flavor profile as the gold standard when trying others on the market bit i always find myself coming back to my first love outstanding  simply an outstanding beverage  spicy and light with a comforting finish  a staple in my home bar rotation   i never let a bottle get near empty without backfilling it with a fresh one i love the cooks champagne however i cannot drink the brut  would love extra dry to become available at sams in mobile al my favorite red wine has been menage a trois for a long time  and this silk blend is even better than the regular blend  the price has remained affordable while the quality has remained consistently good for these red blends my mother turned me on to barefoot riesling a few years back and it had been a reflex to always choose it when given the option been trying to find a red wine with a smooth finish  this stuff is exactly what i was looking for perfect sipping tequila   chilled and neat  perfect sipping tequila   chilled and neat  my buddy ordered some shots of this stuff during a horns game  frankly when it comes to tequila  i usually brace myself for a rough shot  maybe i m drinking the wrong stuff  because this was really easy to put back  no lingering aftertaste  reasonably priced  good value tequila if you re looking straight over ice my drink of choice when i really want to enjoy my time alone makes orange jello taste like creamsicle  strawberry taste like strawberries and cream  lemon taste like lemon meringue i could go on and on get some today pinnacle has been making our martini s in my family for many years  my late father discovered it years ago when someone said it s on par with that vodka that flys south for the winter  but at a very reasonable price  try it  bet you ll love it too  al the whipped creme flavored vodka is fabulous  i keep it in the freezer and have a snifter of it when i want something smooth after dinner or as a night cap  love it everything is great about this product  cheap price  perfect taste  mixing this flavor with just a soda makes it delicious i love this vodka  i have been drinking vodka for many years  and this is by far one of the best  and my favorite vodka  i drink it regularly  usually with grape juice  but also with orange juice  we use it to make daiquiris  and many other frozen concoctions just so so  seems to be missing something  there are much better margarita mixes out there without all the additives this does not have very good summer red  it s become our favorite reasonably priced wine that we enjoy on its own love all of the flavors  will be buying again  great for summer drinks i bought this pack on a whim and i m so glad i did  there is a variety of drinks for a great price  even less than the discount liquor store  i ll definitely get this again vrty good jamaican me happy really enjoy these but sams likes to send you on wild goose chases saying available and none to be found not even the empty pallet we have been buying apothic dark for a couple of years now  it is our red blend of choice  very smooth and very reasonably priced decent table wine for the price  bend that is on the sweeter side of the spectrum rum chata is great when mixed with fireball or caramel vodka love this brand of tequila  i m a margarita fan and like to make different kinds love it wouldnt mind drinking more on a hot day near the water  this is the cheap ish beer to have  bud light with a solid splash of lime  makes it a light and refreshing choice  the target  pack is average priced and will provide a beverage most will enjoy   particularly the ladies love this vodka   it s perfect for screwdrivers  it blends so well with the juice and for an interesting citrus blend  you can use grapefruit juice we ve been drinking this wine for a while  it s one of a group we buy regularly because it s a good wine at an affordable price never disappointed  constant taste a delicious blended wine   give it a try  you might be surprised this is by far the best reisling i ve ever had  love it  always consistent in flavor and my go to great taste don t forget a slice of orage on the side very fruity  smooth  i like it straight over ice with a bit of chambord this is my favorite riesling  when i spotted it on sale for   a bottle i was delighted  i usually pay around   at other locations  buying two bottles saved me six dollars  thanks target refreshing taste of beer especially for summer  citrus combined w  blueberry right on target   sierra nevada torpedo ale has outstanding character  warm  subtle hints of fruit and a strong but not overly bitter hop aftertaste  it is excellent after a hard day s work to kick back and relax  target recently began carrying beer and i could not be more enthused   best beer for the money  wish the club in omaha would carry it

a surprise as an alternate to fume blanc or grigio wines  this is a soft and above average tasty white wine  citrus aroma  gracious acidity  layered texture is enough to satisfy chardonnay as an alternate crisp finish and a nice experience no matter how many different whiskey s there is  not a one  so far  has been able to resist my taste for the love  f jim beam your product is the smoothest going down  and make great gifts i use jim beam to make alot of different kinds of marinades and sauces  i make a honey bourbon marinade for smoking jerky that tastes amazing  everyone says it s the best jerky they ve ever had  thanks for making the best bourbon on the market jim beam wife and i enjoy it mixed with a coke or a monster black cherry  excellent this is my favorite bourbon  i even love its aroma  it has that nice vanilla scent going on  i never get tired of jim beam black i m a single malt scotch guy  i generally have two fingers neat with a quality cigar about once a week  on a stressful day  i ll have a couple of beers or so after work before the family gets home  the trouble is the beer gut that comes with that trend  i was looking for something similar to my favorite scotch  which is a little out of my budget to drink daily  jim beam black is an awesome substitute with the rich white oak aroma and flavor  it isn t near as smooth as my favorite scotch  but the flavor is on point  thank you jim beam for putting this great whiskey out there at an affordable price  you ve got a customer for life exceptionally good flavor no matter where i go after years of various bourbon tastings jim beam black is head and shoulders above the rest no matter what the price tag i m personally a wild turkey drinker  but cudos to jim beam for producing such a classy commercial  got the right girl to be their spokesperson  good job  very classy seriously you ask what s great about it what isn t great about it no explanation necessary i first started drinking jim bean when i went camping  i didnt want to carry the bear around so i tried jim bean  my first was red stag cherry  than i tried devils cut when i came home  i have been hooked ever since  i usually mix with coke or dr pepper this is the best bourbon under   you can buy  one of the smoothest bourbons i ve tasted  i typically drink woodford reserve or eagle rare until i tried this  i buy a bottle every two weeks now this is beam at it s best very smooth i tried jb black for the first time tonight  it is so smooth  we made whiskey sours with it and they were awesome  thanks jim beam for this awesome bourbon i have been enjoying jb black for the past three years  the has all the flavor os a higher proof  bur   i can have another without collapsing  now it has disappeared from even the most extensive liquor stores in my area  what happened the double oaked is ok  but no match for the black  where can i find it in sonoma county  california i bought this in early december and it didn t make it to the new year  this one is awesome  keep up the great work absolutely love  love  love it no explanation necessary to bad they just raised the price   i won t buy it now one of the best on the shelf for under  i purchased this item to make mimosas and had some left over  the mimosas were delicious  i found the california champaign tasteless when too cold and just right at a lesser temperature  of course it is not dom perignon but who would make mimosas with dom  anyway my drink of choice when i really want to enjoy my time alone pinnacle has been making our martini s in my family for many years  my late father discovered it years ago when someone said it s on par with that vodka that flys south for the winter  but at a very reasonable price  try it  bet you ll love it too  al the whipped creme flavored vodka is fabulous  i keep it in the freezer and have a snifter of it when i want something smooth after dinner or as a night cap  love it i love this vodka  i have been drinking vodka for many years  and this is by far one of the best  and my favorite vodka  i drink it regularly  usually with grape juice  but also with orange juice  we use it to make daiquiris  and many other frozen concoctions great run to mix up the rocking fun  get some today and mix away  you won t be disappointed love it  great tast if i m going to buy a sangria  this is not the one i d choose  the flavor was not as fruity as others i ve had and was not pleasant for my palate we are not big wine drinkers but we love this stuff  it is just sweet enough and not as bitter as regular wine and you can really taste the fruity undertones  the price is nice as well  recommended the is absolutely the best sangria ever  hoping sam s continues to carry it  i buy six bottles each visit i have searched high as low for this sangria and it is by far the best tasting  it is not too sweet  and very smooth  i love it chilled because its perfect for a hot summer s day i purchase this every time i go to sam s  then is started to disappear  this last time we went  there was a mini case of six bought them all  scared that something this good might not re appear  please reassure us that you will continue to carry it no after taste love this wine have you ever just wanted a wine that gives you that fruity juicy taste without the hard alcohol kick well this is it still gives you that cocktail buzz without that hard taste  love this stuff even my very picky grandmother loves it what a delightful surprise  excellent taste and aroma  nice after finish i love cabernet and merlot wines  i couldn t even finish a glass of this stuff and that s saying a lot we have been drinking this wine for   years  it s just a good every day table wine that will not break the bank i m a wine girl from way back  had a lot of pricey wines  some i liked  some i poured down the drain  same with cheaper wine usually i stay right in the middle to be happiest  however  a close friend recommended this one to me a couple of years ago as a nice  everyday wine  and i have to say that for those purposes  this is one of my favorites it s not often that you come across a wine this bad  i ve tasted cooking wines that were better  unfortunately  my wife bought four bottles of this stuff  tried to return it  but sam s wouldn t accept it  not that i blame them  i d pour it down the sink  but it might damage the pipes  sigh i am not happy they only carry cans  the bottles are much better bring them back please yummmmmmyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy this beer is delicious  but i have to tell you that it is quite sweet  so if you don t like cream soda  you won t like it  in my case  it is perfect and i absolutely love it it was very fresh and cheaper than anywhere in the area i bought this  best price and great convenience to order online  pick up in store  great job  super easy made our party special  everyone was pleased with our choice of drinks really enjoy  no strong tannin after taste  ok price  we pull out a bottle to have w  pizza  red sauce dishes  found this to be a smooth red w  meals everyone i share this with  loves it  great tasting and soft  with no harsh aftertaste i bought two bottles of meiomi and give one to a friend  i enjoyed drinking my bottle but was wondering if it can be aged i just bought a fifth of jim beam apple and mixed it with ice cold mtn dew  it was great especially if you add a twist of fresh lemon we buy this bottle every week but the only thing we do not like is that every time you take the top off it leaves a black residue in the drink and a gross smell on your hand from twisting the top off   if you guys could fix that then it would be twice more amazing i went to my local store to purchase another apple flavored product but saw this decided to purchase jim beam apple instead  i m glad that i did  i mix my jim beam with cranberry juice and if i want it to be a little fizzy i ll add some seagram s ginger ale  love this drink and will be purchasing more soon i was hesitant to buy jim beam apple  after trying other apple whiskeys  but i was not disappointed  it s so smooth  light and fruity  very good i mix the jim beam apple with a little ginger ale  it is a great summer refreshment first time trying it i love it  great tasting smooth blend  awesome price too sip then have an orange slice need salt or a lime but the addition of it makes it even better drink very good flavor without a over powering finish  never need salt or a lime but the addition of it makes it even better one of my favorite silver tequilas use for shots this is hands down my favorite tequila  amazing taste at an amazing price  no lime salt needed drink very good flavor without a over powering finish  never need salt or a lime but the addition of it makes it even better one of my favorite silver tequilas this is a fruity dessert wine  since i had my first taste of a gewurtztraminer wine i have bought wine from this grape from   different countries  and vineyards  this fetzer gewurtztraminer has the best flavor and body of all the ones i ve tried  it s hard to find  but worth trying  if you ve never tried a wine from this grape before best beer on market  mans beer  leaves hoppy aftertaste  approx    cals per   oz  maintain exercise if drinking two or more per day it will add weight great refreshing taste  not a weak beer  safe ingredients that are non gmo yuck  i m the type who usually rants and raves over trump brands  but this wine is awful  was so shocked  i spilled it all over my favorite brown shirt  sad best  beer  ever  end of review great value awesome taste just can t be beat my favorite chardonney my momma loves this stuff  its the taste that will rockur socks off i have been enjoying jim beam original for many years  i started mixing jb o with slice while wife and i watched dallas  i have tried other whiskeys  but keep coming back to jb  now i enjoy it mixed with diet pepsi  since i can no longer find slice it goes great in apple cider a true classic of spirits i love this bourbon as it is always my first choice when its time to unwind  whether its neat  on rocks  with a coke or ginger ale  or my grandpa s whiskey sour  nothing tops jim beam  nothing to make manhattens best bourbon i have found have toured distillery and love the brand very smooth sweet wine  just wish wine companies would mark wine with dry  medium dry  sweet  extra sweet i was told at a wine store that this wine is more of a mix of two different red wines  other then the fact that it leaves a bit of red on my lips even after i ve finished drinking i loved it  if you enjoy bitter red wines this is pretty good  i ve tried many cheaper bitter red wines and the price point and quality of this so far has been great  i d definitely suggest giving this a try you just might like it at a great price i been drinking riunite for years it s great with food  partying with friends and family  or just relaxing  i will be buying it for the holidays to go with my gumbo this wine taste really good  i love the soft flavor  i will buy this again this is the wine  at a wonderful club price  why isn t the rosa and other ones carried by sam s this wine is amazing it s not too sweet not to bitter  it is a great inexpensive wine fruity  full body  cheap  go well with asian foods  if you are looking to buy a red for wedding  this is the one  i got so many compliments from my anniversary this year on this red  if you want the cheaper wine  sure  you can go with veo or menage a trois though  carnivor is still a great wine i bought this wine for my christmas party and everyone loved it  especially the guests who d never had wine before  bartenura moscato beat out all the other kinds that i d set out for the party had a chance to try some this beverage  wonderful sparkling taste  great for celebrations i tried this wine for the first time and it s delicious i love it  i now have a favorite wine i

a glass of this roscato and you are set  it is not sparkling  dry  or overbearing  definitely my go to this roscato is sweet  very crisp and mildly sweet  but it is delicious thise wine is a copy cat of the original what full light sweet tasteing table wine  also very good to cook with great flavor the bottles are very pretty we haven t opened them yet  they look just like the picture pink with the emoji on them  delivery was on time wanted watkins products root beer extract but it seems it is no longer available  this brand is all right but do not like the caramel color additive  watkins is

my husband adds this to his beer instead of tomato juice great product it is the best mixer ever   good price too we enjoy this mix more than any other this zing zang bloody mary mix is delicious  very peppery   our new favorite mix   spicy  terrific bloody mary mix i have tried a lot of bloody mary mixes  even sent away across country for a good mix and this is by far the best out there  of course i add celery  scallions  stuffed olives and some rosemary and this is perfect and have not had any better  wal mart just started carrying this but i have been using for years awesome my first choice in mixers love love love this is also good in red beers  lots of spices and tang have been using this for bloody mary s for years  best one we ever had  could stand to lower the price a one dollar to match sam s club s price  sam s was out of stock  price is still a little lower than other retail stores in the area the best bloody mary mix ever this is the best if you like a zingy bloody mary  this is the mix  no need to mess with any additional spices i am a cabo and patron anejo snob  who wouldn t drink jose quervo to save my own life  jose quervo is not tequila  but solana silver is  i wanted to try a silver  and picked this up on a gamble  at half the price of what i normally buy    agava smooth tasted like tequila should solana blanco is a very mild tasting tequila  if you see it on a walmart shelf  grab it and try it  you will not be disappointed  it flies off the shelf at my store maple crown is by far my favorite whiskey to date  it goes great with coca cola products  a must buy tastes like juice that makes you unwind  perfect for that end of the day glass  i only wish it were easier to find  my local store is often out of stock i m a single malt scotch guy  i generally have two fingers neat with a quality cigar about once a week  on a stressful day  i ll have a couple of beers or so after work before the family gets home  the trouble is the beer gut that comes with that trend  i was looking for something similar to my favorite scotch  which is a little out of my budget to drink daily  jim beam black is an awesome substitute with the rich white oak aroma and flavor  it isn t near as smooth as my favorite scotch  but the flavor is on point  thank you jim beam for putting this great whiskey out there at an affordable price  you ve got a customer for life exceptionally good flavor no matter where i go after years of various bourbon tastings jim beam black is head and shoulders above the rest no matter what the price tag i m personally a wild turkey drinker  but cudos to jim beam for producing such a classy commercial  got the right girl to be their spokesperson  good job  very classy seriously you ask what s great about it what isn t great about it no explanation necessary i first started drinking jim bean when i went camping  i didnt want to carry the bear around so i tried jim bean  my first was red stag cherry  than i tried devils cut when i came home  i have been hooked ever since  i usually mix with coke or dr pepper this is the best bourbon under   you can buy  one of the smoothest bourbons i ve tasted  i typically drink woodford reserve or eagle rare until i tried this  i buy a bottle every two weeks now this is beam at it s best very smooth i tried jb black for the first time tonight  it is so smooth  we made whiskey sours with it and they were awesome  thanks jim beam for this awesome bourbon i have been enjoying jb black for the past three years  the has all the flavor os a higher proof  bur   i can have another without collapsing  now it has disappeared from even the most extensive liquor stores in my area  what happened the double oaked is ok  but no match for the black  where can i find it in sonoma county  california i bought this in early december and it didn t make it to the new year  this one is awesome  keep up the great work absolutely love  love  love it i really like this soda  it has a sweet  earthy apple flavor  and a bite that warms your tummy  i have already shared this with a friend  who also loved it  i would definitely buy this again  and probably will soon it is a very good drink it has a marvolous taste and a very good value including that it is non alcoholic i recomend it to any one who wants to ahve a drink without the hangover and the risk of getting drunk great for cooking full of flavor spice no need to add all of the extras except vodka of course this is by far the best bloody mary mix on the market the only thing you will have to add is your preferred garnish and lime if you like it  tastes great w o alcohol  just on the rocks too great mix just the right amount of spice not only is this item great for bloody mary s  but it s super for chili lots of great taste all in one mix i like the product because you can drink it straight for a refreshing drink over ice   since told about the product i have made several purchases and recommend this for a different drink of choice used at birthday party and everyone enjoyed it  will purchase again love the flavor and the spice  great bloody mary s or red beer great for bloody mary s or a dressed chelada love it i do however wish they had it in individual servings no bitter after taste  just spicy enough  price was a good price best bloody mary mix ever this is not an easy find  so glad jet has it  this review was collected as part of a promotion did not buy for any special occasion but great to have around to mix up when friends come by  this review was collected as part of a promotion i really enjoy drinks made with mr  mrs  t  sometimes i mix half bloody mary mix and either v  or clamto juice  tastes great great product at a great price no other brand comes close to the excellent taste not very tasty at all this is great i ve been drinking this stuff since i was a little kid and i am in my  s now  clamato is delicious  very unique taste that i love  i can chug this stuff faster than water  i d sponsor clamato if i could  lol what has to happened clamato over the past few months i have noticed a distinct difference in the taste of clamato original  there seems to be less clam juice taste and more tomato and sweet taste  is it just me or has anyone else noticed i want more clam hello i wanted to know if this drink has an expiration date because i dont see it   or how long can it last ecen when is not open and when it is it s tasty and with beer and vodka or by its self and drink it just about with every day i lke drink it   a glass white lime and salt  taste so good  and no more hangover love it  recommend to all bloody drinkers  tell everybody to try it dark ales  specially british  and clamato  picante or original mineral water  topo chico  with limn and salt and clamato best thing ever i ve been drinking for over   years love this stuff and you can drink by itself better flavor than v  have a glass every morning for breakfast love to have  once bud light with  onces of clamato my dad introduced me to this years ago when mixing up bloody mary s as a bartender for   plus years clamato is still my favorite for bloody marys and red beer  yum very good refreshing and would highly recommend to friends and family had it as an appetizer   years ago and drank it ever since i simply love clamato   its simply delicious  however  the sodium content is so high that i do not drink it at all anymore  if a low sodium version was made it would be the only product of this nature i would purchase this product as well as many others would be more appealing to me and others if the hfcs was replaced with cane sugar  you have a good product and there are ways to make it better  an increase in price would not deter me in the least  look at the growth of the organic industry  need i say more my husband has been drinking this for a few years he does enjoy it way tastier than v without a doubt  the only way to make an authentic michelada i love this stuff it needs to be cheeper and not so much salt other then that i drink it like water lol its awesome stuff the best mix i have ever used for bloody mary just need to spice it up a little with flavored vodka try it you will love it lime juice  tapatio sauce clamato juice and bud light good stuff  good by itself  anytime breakfast   lunch and dinner hello i wanted to know if this drink has an expiration date because i dont see it   or how long can it last ecen when is not open and when it is clamato almost seems like they are embarrassed this great cocktail is seasoned with clams  i wish there were more clam juice in it  as they never mention that part of the name sake  be proud you created such an awesome drink and it is indeed seasoned with clam juice put more in please i love this juice  it makes great red beers  bloody mary s  red bulls  etc  plus it is great just by itself i was shyed away at first from clamato  strange enough  i love bloody mary s and all i eat is seafood  so  one would think  clams and tomato juice wouldn t be a problem  well  i made my own bloody caesar with clamato at home  a touch of cracked pepper  hot sauce  old bay seasoning  and it was fantastic this is a good price on this item  this review was collected as part of a promotion nice i use clamato to make bloody mary s    clamato    vodka    zingzang  mix and enjoy i bought this for my   year old grandson  he loves it and says it taste very good i like this way better than tomato juice packaging was awkward but understandable addictively tasty i love this product as i have chronic kidney disease and it is allowed for me  i only wish that i could find a coupon for it like i do for v  that isn t good for me i really like clamato juice  i tried it because i thought that the savory notes of clam juice would be refreshing  and it really is the most delicious  refreshing  salty drink ever  i ve made sure to always keep a bottle in the fridge very good i fell in love with clamato over   yrs ago  my mom drank it and so i was introduced to it at a young age  now as an adult i absolutely love it alone or mixing it up for some micheladas with my pops  we always have at least   bottles in the fridge i have been drinking clamato for years and using it as a mixer for years  nothing else compares  bring back beefmoto i have diabetes and chronic kidney disease and i love clamato juice cocktail and it is good for my kidney and my diabetes  i have at least one glass a day very refreshing served iced cold best item i have ever purchased  hands down  so delicious  words can t do it justice  my favorite part is the clams  and also the tomato  how is it possible to unite two vastly different flavor a in such a harmonizing blend i don t know  but the result is beautiful and so delicious  i will definitely purchase again  actually i am on the way right now  walmart that is  to buy clamato clamato does not have a distinct clam flavor it s refreshing and with a nice balance to the tomato and clam and lime and spices  it s a nice alternative to v  or tomato juice and works well in a cocktail blend this is my favorite beverage  do not be afraid of the clam and tomato mix  it is fantastic  we drink a container per week  some as bloody mary  caesar  it has to be popular because walmart is frequently sold out  i have tried the picante version  but the original is the best makes great bloody marys the clamato cocktail is the best juice i have tasted in a long time  i have a small glass with every dinner  good flavor  great taste this is the absolute best tomato juice to use in a bloody mary  because it contains clam juice  the drink is called a clam digger  buy this all the time  mix it with vodka  worcestershire sauce  lemon juice and hot sauce  best drink being from canada it so so good to see motts clamato juice was available at walmart  we all know you can t make a ceasar without it  there is a difference  a ceasar is made with clamato juice  a bloody mary is with tomato juice i didnt like the idea of clam and tomato juice  but tried it anyway  i was pleasantly surprised with its refreshing taste  whether it is served over ice  or as a part of a mixed drink  it is excellent is good by its self or added to your favorite hop beverage  i only use clamoto for my shrimp cocteau s and drinks  love the freshness i love clamato  i can t have alcohol due to health issues  but i make a mean virgin drink  add celery salt and a couple squeezes of lime juice  stir with a celery stalk  yum great value on this size bottle it s far from natural    clam powder  but delicious this is good as drinking alone or mixing with your choice of other beverages my husband loves to use this as an ingredient for mexican shrimp cocktail it s delicious  he also enjoys to drink it alone love this stuff  very tasty very smooth and light flavor was a hit the town at the end i love become the clam and tomato blend with in this product i have been a user of clamato for quite a while  i was glad to find i could order it from walmart online as it is not always available in our store excellent flavor   i drink it by itself  but mostly i use this to make my bloody mary s  i love to buy clamato at walmart the price is very good and the product is good i buy it for my micheladas clamato almost seems like they are embarrassed this great cocktail is seasoned with clams  i wish there were more clam juice in it  as they never mention that part of the name sake  be proud you created such an awesome drink and it is indeed seasoned with clam juice put more in please this is great  we use cream of coconut often  we hate to have to buy cans that we can save after use  this coco real product allows to use the amount needed and save the rest  the taste of coco real is wonderful  we ve used it for drinks and even on burgers  never a complaint they were a big hit at my daughters wedding i love this stuff  i add vodka and freeze  then scoop out and its a great slushi the mix inside the container smells very similar to kool aid  it is a good sugary drink mix when access to a blender or the time to make a homemade product is unavailable  it s decent for the price though my guest seemed to like it  a word of caution before pouring anything into the bucket carefully inspect the bottom of the bucket and spout for damage  on one of these my bucket was uknowlingly damaged and i lost a substantial amount as my margarita dripped out into the freezer    cheers if you love frozen drinks this is easy preparation and great tasting  not just for parties we added rum and this made a great refreshing dink to have my the pool had to order online  not offered in store  wish they had these in the store  shipping was quick and prompt  showed up in store a day early  perfect for game night  delicious  easy to make the taste is awesome excellent this should be available in store it was very similar to what i had gotten before at xmas tree shop so was happy with that  same ease of mixing too  same taste  but while waiting for it to be delivered i found it at market basket for less money plus i would have saved the shipping this is the best strawberry margarita daiquiri mix on the market  it s hard to find  it s a shame walmart stopped carrying it in their stores my husband says he loves the flavor tastes delicious with or without vodka it is the best sence snappy tom god and tasty love the extra kick i have been drinking it for quite awhile  like it better than hot v can t beat the deal  this review was collected as part of a promotion it s delicious i would highly recommend it i use this for cooking  just enough kick shipped well without spillage  love this product in place of v being from louisiana  love the spicy excellent i biy it by the case every week this is so nice having the big bottle of bloody mary mix  can t find this in the store most of the time and even when they carry the large bottle it is usually in the original flavor and not the spicy  good deal compared to other places if you are looking for a spicy bloody mary this mix is great i enjoyed the flavor we have tried several different bloody mary mixes and have found this one to be the one we like the best a friend told me about this product and i tried it and i loved it  i wish that i had knew about it sooner tasty excellent  thick and rich with just the right amount of kick  i always ordered this on the jets when i travelled it s really good  right amputated of spice if you like spicey i loved it  not too spicy just enough kick  way better than the original not spicy at all but does the job by far the best mix for a good bloody mary  i love the flavor this product did not have any flavor  it was very bland to call itself spicy i think they are putting too much sucrose in the mix  while good it would be better with less sweetness a well balanced and good tasting mix  i would recommend this mix we love the smooth  bubbly taste  we drink it with orange juice for brunch every weekend  without the oj  it s just as delicious paired with seafood or a girls night out so good  i like the hotter bourbons  and at   there is nothing better at this price point  this is like a stagg jr that you can actually find at retail price  or find at all  underrated  and i just assume it stays that way i am a single malt scotch aficianado  recently i have decided to embrace my american heritage by trying bourbons  in the back of my mind  i had the suspicion  that such nationalistic ideals are doomed to fail but oh my goodness  the knob creek kentucky straight is everything i have desired  rich  mellow  fruity  and sufficiently heavy to keep me light knob creek has become my go to  mixed with ginger ale or straight  you can t go wrong with knob creek s kentucky straight bourbon whiskey one of my simple pleasures in life is a knob creek   proof on the rocks  it is fantastic i have loved it since the first time i tried it  however  in my country it s not sold  in a recent trip abroad  i finally found it and bought a bottle  now i m looking forward to share it with friends  wonderful bourbon straight or on ice  smooth and no bite from the first sniff in the glass to finally reaching my lips  aaa  bourbon  very happy with my purchase  i ve already told my buddies to come by for a taste for   proof  this bourbon is sweet and mellow  the slight burn at the finish reminds you that you are still alive previous bottles stated aged nine years  last bottle purchased shows no age  taste appeared a little harsher than previously this is a superb quality whiskey  my go to this is a go to bourbon for me  a friend recommended the   year as a good  full bodied bourbon at a really good price and needless to say it didn t disappoint  i typically have either neat or at times over an  oversized  ice cube  either way  i get really good  smooth flavors  somewhat woody  somewhat caramel ly  and enjoy it on a regular basis  i consider this to be one the best bourbons for a really good price a bright amber dram that is bold yet soft on the back of the tongue and lights a fire on the way down  the nose is a velvety riot of vanilla and caramel that finishes with a hint of sour mash  it is the kind of whiskey that a man would choose to enjoy after a hunt or after a wake to remember good times and good friends wow  what a punch  yet smooth enough to enjoy this tastes great for the price and is as close to the captain as i have found i bought   of these for a small wedding dinner  went over well  this is a standard sweet sparkling asti with consistent quality and reasonable price year after year good price and product light crispy flavor  very refreshing add a little salt and it is perfect this tastes amazing  so far the best from jasper s the magic potion is just annoying to brew with  when you add it to the beer it turns into a mucusy substance and you need to strain it out which is really hard  other than that it is great i haven t had a chance to brew this beer  but everything about the process has been great so far  they are in state  so the package arrived timely and the protective shipping package was superb  the kit even has a funny coffee stain on it with a note basically saying they wont explain   but it s important  funny detail  and gives me a sense of their personality  also  due to this specific brew   you can probably expect your box to smell as absolutely jaw droppingly amazing as mine  spice  malts  sweetness  ughhhh  i keep opening and closing the box and sniffing the bags so much that my girlfriend is getting annoyed the actual product itself is quite comprehensive   best kit i ve purchased thus far  it comes with stickers for your bottle caps   great idea guys  was comparatively priced against competitors beers  a large bag of liquid malt  a smaller bag of dry malt  a can of pumpkin pie mix  debating tossing in another can on my own  brown sugar  a long vanilla bean stalk with a pouch of cinnamon  bittering hops  cheesecloth  priming sugar and dry yeast  wow  excellent care in their product for an absolutely appropriate price i cannot wait to brew this beer  and i absolutely anticipate doing a lot more business with jaspers my  rd homebrew ever and a step up from my other kit beers  it smelled so amazing brewing and fermenting  despite my rookie mistake by moving it to secondary fermentation after active fermentation was over it was a forgiving beer  carbonation was slow but at   weeks it s maturing into a tasty  wickedly good beer  mouth feel and foamy head throughout  yes i hear the snickers  but a fantastic beer  will be brewing my next batch soon and just tried another jasper s product shut the fck up amber   already in secondary fermentation   well played  boomchugalug i bought two of these kits to make ten gallons  after   weeks in the     gallon primary s i kegged   gallons  the instructions for the vodka  spices and vanilla bean slurry were vague as to when to make the potion and how to store it  i mixed mine on brew day and it sat in the fridge while the beer fermented  it turned into a snot ball  i sanitized a mason jar and took half the ten gallons worth of potion mixture and while i kegged i added some beer to the jar and shook it vigorously to break up the snot ball  it worked for the most part  the first   beers came out a bit chunky but it cleared up  the potion made the beer taste a bit like cider  it s got a very upfront pumkin spice kick with hints of cinnamon  i m not a big fan of these prominent flavors so i bottled the second   gallons without the potion overall the kits good  the abv came out at about   after adding an extra pound of dextrose i expect he bottles to be a bit more to my liking this is an extract kit  i don t recall seeing that anywhere in the description  good beer though this product always deliver quality and freshness as many other goya products  grew up drinking several brands but goya delivers the best one  deserve an excellent mark  but unfortunately the delivery process is slow at times and my last order still missing from my door front sweet and tasty great product  arrived with one broken  which made quite a big mess in the box i don t think this taste wonderful but i can chug it  it works great for women breastfeeding who want to increase their breast milk can t beat the price  very happy it s a good product always a classic  never disappoints  never had another sugar cane drink as good as this one  but then again  it is goya so you know it s good this beverage is really good for anyone who wants to remember puerto rico i m from pr and puertoricans love malta  it is really good that walmart bring our products these tortilla strips have a great flavor and pare well with salads and soups  i enjoy the added flavor to any type of salad  they are so good in a bowl of soup and remain crispy longer than you woukd expect i have had better strips  when i opened package found them slightly stale  sure enough check the expire date oct   well shoot  bought in oct  i should have known better  used them in soup and tossed the rest these tortilla chips are not only good  they are attractive and appealing looking on a salad perfect sipping tequila   chilled and neat  my buddy ordered some shots of this stuff during a horns game  frankly when it comes to tequila  i usually brace myself for a rough shot  maybe i m drinking the wrong stuff  because this was really easy to put back  no lingering aftertaste  reasonably priced  good value tequila if you re looking straight over ice i m a single malt scotch guy  i generally have two fingers neat with a quality cigar about once a week  on a stressful day  i ll have a couple of beers or so after work before the family gets home  the trouble is the beer gut that comes with that trend  i was looking for something similar to my favorite scotch  which is a little out of my budget to drink daily  jim beam black is an awesome substitute with the rich white oak aroma and flavor  it isn t near as smooth as my favorite scotch  but the flavor is on point  thank you jim beam for putting this great whiskey out there at an affordable price  you ve got a customer for life exceptionally good flavor no matter where i go after years of various bourbon tastings jim beam black is head and shoulders above the rest no matter what the price tag i m personally a wild turkey drinker  but cudos to jim beam for producing such a classy commercial  got the right girl to be their spokesperson  good job  very classy seriously you ask what s great about it what isn t great about it no explanation necessary i first started drinking jim bean when i went camping  i didnt want to carry the bear around so i tried jim bean  my first was red stag cherry  than i tried devils cut when i came home  i have been hooked ever since  i usually mix with coke or dr pepper this is the best bourbon under   you can buy  one of the smoothest bourbons i ve tasted  i typically drink woodford reserve or eagle rare until i tried this  i buy a bottle every two weeks now this is beam at it s best very smooth i tried jb black for the first time tonight  it is so smooth  we made whiskey sours with it and they were awesome  thanks jim beam for this awesome bourbon i have been enjoying jb black for the past three years  the has all the flavor os a higher proof  bur   i can have another without collapsing  now it has disappeared from even the most extensive liquor stores in my area  what happened the double oaked is ok  but no match for the black  where can i find it in sonoma county  california i bought this in early december and it didn t make it to the new year  this one is awesome  keep up the great work absolutely love  love  love it they don t state on the label how much ginger is in their ginger ale  i am to deduce that there isn t any  since they won t list it on the ingredients label i bought the   oz cans to keep in refrigerator for nausea  it workes miracles and what a perfect size love canada dry until about a month ago every carton i ve purchased has been flat no fizz and just bad tasting i ve used canada dry for years so certainly know good from bad  has there been a change cause they surely don t taste good good coffee  medium roast    with natural ingredients  ingredients  water coffee extract sugar milk powder soy lecithin  emulsifier this is the best mix to use for appletinis  taste great  i have tried others but nothing compares to rose  everyone always comments on the cool bottle  it is on the sweet side but that is why i like it  try it was looking everywhere for this product  and was starting to think that i would be out of luck  tried walmart com as a last resort  glad i did  thank you wal mart taste just like i thought it would   would buy again tasty this is great for moscow miles  it is very gingery and tastes much better than its higher priced competitor these franks are by far the best tasting franks we have had in a long time  love grilling them and having them just like at the ball park good size and taste for a get together foot ball game easy to preper saves you time and money great cuantity too good brand  has a good flavor and a cheaper price  been buying this brand for years  never had a complaint weiner s are very good  reasonable price i purchase these and separate and freeze them  i have  boys so they are always handy great for grilling and a great value this is a light  slightly bubbly tasting wine  not too sweet  not too bitter and dry are you not selling oak leaf wine in a box anymore we have been to   different wal marts without finding any  this in a box is great  please do not stop carrying it perfect sipping tequila   chilled and neat  my buddy ordered some shots of this stuff during a horns game  frankly when it comes to tequila  i usually brace myself for a rough shot  maybe i m drinking the wrong stuff  because this was really easy to put back  no lingering aftertaste  reasonably priced  good value tequila if you re looking straight over ice the white label or the devil s cut dashed with some lemonade and lime cordial is how i enjoy my jim best drink you can get to make manhattens best bourbon i have found have toured distillery and love the brand red stag and coke zero is my go to drink  only wish more bars and restaurants stocked it  nothing like a good bourbon with a cherry kick  i like it with dr peper to sip and relax better than the other s drank it for years and always smooth and tasty  now it is running off the shelves at our liquor store i keep jim beam on hand every day of the week i typically have this neat or with an ice cube  its light amber appearance  sweet  woody  mossy nose  and its mild moss  white oak  mellow wintergreen mint  and dried  faintly candied fruit flavor draws the drinker into an exploration of pin point distilling execution  jim beam original has a gradual finish  with a ghost of chocolate powder  during the fade out  highly recommended  rjt it s does have a great toaste to it the only drink i ll drink i had a neat   finger glass two weeks ago of jb black label for the first time  i ve always drank jack daniels  and i loved it  no more jack for me best tasteing and defenetly the smoothest around i love it i always keep a bottle of jim bean in my liquor cabinet  value for price is incredible and it mixes great if you love the taste of grapes this is your gonna love this great wine  a keeper in my cabin i m not a drinker and this taste delicious  i like it i use with blue agave light golden syrup an one lime over ice with gold sauza tequila perfect drink it s a bit sweet but blends up well my husband and his friend  who had never had a pia colada  thought this was awesome  perfect and easy to make for sitting around the pool on a very warm humid day great product pricing fast delivery  one great product  hard to find in the   ounce bottles  makes a great old fashion  note  use with splenda makes a very low calorie drink they barely have a hint of buffalo flavor  if you like your wings to taste of nothing but pepper than these are for you  they have plenty of flavor to them just not what your expecting for buffalo flavor  now the wings themselves are not bad  they are decently meaty  maybe a little to heavy on the breading  but not to bad though  the sizes of the wings vary greatly but not really a big deal  i d by them again if they change the flavoring  but i d say just stick to the plain and get your own sauce i did not have the same experience as the other reviewer  what we got was just as advertised   chunks of white meat in breading  my kids love these they had chicken  they were breaded  they didn t even need a dipping sauce the last time i bought buffalo wings  i bought a name brand  i was very disappointed with them as they had almost no heat at all  i bought the great value brand last time and i was apprehensive  but i could not believe how much flavor they had and how spicy they were  they were delicious quick  easy  and delicious i have to be honest for boneless chicken wyngz  these are definitely my favorite  i prefer them over the tyson brand  the only complaint i have is they are very hard to get in my local store  they are regularly out of them  that can be frustrating there delicious these great value buffalo style boneless wyngz are extremely hot  if you like spicy  hot  flavors in your food then these are for you  i thought they cooked up well  but i just did not care for the spicy hotness of them we usually buy the tyson any tizer boneless wings but bought these to save a little money  big mistake  these wings have twice the sodium as the tyson chicken and you can definitely tell by the taste  we ended up throwing the whole bag away  next time we ll spend the extra dollar tried these on a whim found much better than the usual name brand i buy we opened the bag and see nice sized chunks of chicken  we were mistaken  we see maybe   or   pieces of good sized chunks but the rest were tiny and mostly breading these pack some heay  good but spicy hot and irregular cuts of chicken not all of the walmarts around me have them so i always go to the one that carries them even though it s further away  yum yum yum these chicken wyngz were gross  way too much breading  and the taste of buffalo sauce was barely noticeable  at the price walmart sells these at  i can t recommend them on any level we go through a bag of these the first day i bring them home  they have the perfect amount of spicy  i do wish there were more in the bag was very dry the chicken did not have much flavor and tasted cheap the wings were nasty game and some wings  life is good they are good  just thought that it would be spicier my son loves them  great flavor and great price my son and grandson love these wings favor is better  meat is tender even in microwave   price is reasonable great price too my favorite very tender and juice  will buy again taste great tastes great       extremely hard to beat the price  but it seems to be very hard to find   in stock   one of the managers told me that a large display of it just sat all summer   i personally don t understand it   ever since i found it   i go out of my way to buy it  i personally like it more than some of the more expensive beers      for the price you can t beat this beer mild good taste enjoy perfect sipping tequila   chilled and neat  my buddy ordered some shots of this stuff during a horns game  frankly when it comes to tequila  i usually brace myself for a rough shot  maybe i m drinking the wrong stuff  because this was really easy to put back  no lingering aftertaste  reasonably priced  good value tequila if you re looking straight over ice excellent cucumber taste  makes the perfect summer cocktails expensive this really is the best root beer i have ever tasted  i usually buy it in our grocery store  about   per four pack  but it s sold out a lot  the ingredients are clean and natural  while most of the other root beers have junk ingredients  caramel color  i quit drinking traditional sodas years ago  because of the nasty ingredients and taste  virgil s is absolute heaven in a root beer float  virgil s root beer is micro

per case  from virgils rootbeer i have mixed feelings about virgil s rootbeer  to start with  the root and bark of the sassafras tree are no longer used  as they cause cancer and liver damage  the sarsaparilla vine used to be used  but nowadays  most root beers use an artificial sarsaparilla flavor  virgil s is naturally brewed from sweet birch  and a lot of other natural flavors  the licorice does not improve it  it contains too much sugar  and it is packaged in a breakable glass bottle  processed food makers in general use far too much sugar and salt than is good for us  virgil s rootbeer

it is the best tasting and healthy root beer ever  i am giving this as gifts to friends and family i only stumbled upon this after reading it s apparently created by walmart  it s a private label brand from what i read  not sure how true that is  but the taste was good all throughout  but i still have   or   left in the case to try  at a little less than a dollar per can  the price can t be beat  if you want to try something different lol need salt or a lime but the addition of it makes it even better drink very good flavor without a over powering finish  never need salt or a lime but the addition of it makes it even better one of my favorite silver tequilas use for shots this is hands down my favorite tequila  amazing taste at an amazing price  no lime salt needed i absolutely love this wine  with moscato d asti being my favorite  i have tried several brands  stella rosa is my absolute favorite  i won t try any others  it s crisp and sweet with no icky aftertaste  i love it very good sweet moscato tasted great twist off cap may easy to me if you put it down so it was knock down it would not spill out if you have cap on good a very good idea very good buy i understood some towards contributions go towards veterans  for those of you who want to enjoy a nice beverage that is not as sweet  try this mix  my husband has been purchasing this for some time now  added to that  we pay the   yearly one time purchase to have future items from walmart shipped to your home free  so worth the cost this product seems to help my liver if i take it before eating very happy to get more bitters in my diet  and they are organic this didn t taste like olive juice from an actual jar of olives  it tasted a bit sweeter or like it was synthetic  i wouldn t recommend i really like this product   it s the best out there  however  the combination of the occasional bad  mold  bottle  and the glass breakage leaking  for the price point it s not worth the hassle  if i can buy it locally i will  otherwise i have to give up on dirty sue  way better then using juice from the olives  best martinis i have made yet great addition to my martini monday      absolutely perfect  will reorder often really good stuff hubby says it s ok  but he prefers the olive juice in a jar of olives great for bloody mary s great stuff very satisfied it s a little too dirty but we used the whole bottle in a couple of weeks very tasty  just the mix i was looking for  good quality we have used other martini mixes  but this one is definitely the best  with a good vodka  the drinks are so smooth not bitter very  very good love this for my dirty martinis  the taste is very good great addition to dirty martinis above and beyond super good i like martinis about as dirty as they can come  this stuff is just the bomb  it s so much more flavorful than any olive juice i ve tasted from olives in a jar  it s full bodied  not just briny go ahead  you re definitely worth it have always loved dirty sue  arrives on time and works great in martini s it was everything i thought it would be and i would buy it again so far dirty sue martini mix is the best we have ever used   dirty sue is the best mix for dirty martini s that i have found a staple that we now can t live without makes the best dirty  tini s my go to for dirty martini s and it should be yours good dirty mix  a bit expensive so gave it   stars just the right mix to make my dirty martinis dirty i have tried every si gle kind of olive juice and have been extremely disappointed in all  even threw them out  in every case but dirty sue  this just can t be beat great  too bad it isn t available locally this is the stuff  delicious  i wanted to drink the bottle without the martini  i would definitely order thus again delicious  i recently went through a dirty martini phase and was frustrated with the inconsistent quality of my drinks  some were fabulous while others tasted outright disgusting  a waste of precious quality vodka  i quickly figured out that for me  only salt brines will do  no vinegar i was discarding a lot of expensive olives for the sake of a few drinks and thought surely there must be a source for brine only  i read reviews and ingredient lists until finding dirty sue  this product ain t cheap  it s salt water after all  but i was not disappointed  like i said before  no vinegar  i m very pleased  will be purchasing several bottles for christmas and pairing them with a nice vodka as gifts love it  but getting a little pricey  order     oz instead of a   pack of   oz  may be making slightly less dirty martinis dirty sue  the perfect companion for the perfect martini  will never cheat on her  highly recommend you give her a try  there s enough love to go around   if you want to make a good dirty martini  this is the stuff that is going to help you  it is the only olive juice my husband will take in his martinis and really the only one we ever have on hand always  because we do entertain a lot  this gets bought often and is enjoyed by all it makes the biggest difference  i tried to use brine as a substitute   horrible taste  it s the real deal  a true mixer  can t mix another dirty martini without it good stuff  one of the two best  the other being olive squeezins from fl  you can find on the market this product is great  i am a general manager at an upscale restaurant in hollywood  ca and i was tired of having my bartenders taking the time to drain the brine out of jars of olives  it s a huge waste of time  and the olives when separated from the brine dry out almost immediately  once i discovered dirty sue  not only did it fix these problems  but it allows me to offer my guests a much higher quality of olive juice  let s face it  if a patron is going to order a high end gin or vodka martini  why would they want a sub par ingredient mixed with it i cant even drink a dirty martini anymore if i dont have dirty sue  i use a shot of it in bloody mary s too  there is no comparison to the juice found in olive jars  this stuff is like the top shelf of olive brine  i highly recommend it if you like dirty martini s  this is the only way to go  the tasteis outta this world and it s a superior juice than the stuff thatcomes in olive jars to preserve the olives  ask for it at your local bar this is just what i have been looking for as a lover of a good strong dirty martini i am known for having a refer full of juiceless olive jars  dirty sue was truly a find  i keep plenty of it stocked enough to share with my fiends and even those mere acquaintances that stop by taste s great  no sugar free after taste  i mix with soda water excellent product very easy to use very useful when it comes to the holidays i highly recommend it if you are not skilled in the preparation of cocktails i liked all of the favors  i was pleasantly surprised that these didn t have that no calorie drink aftertaste  the alcohol of course adds calories but you save about   using these instead of the ones with calories  the strawberry lemonade was the best  i used cheaper tequila  jose cuervo  which was just fine i like the modern cocktail packs  but was a little misled by the description for this one on amazon possibly not the manufacturer s fault   their package description is spot on on amazon it says something like  add gin or vodka for martinis and other similar drinks but this one is all formulated for tequila   all the drinks are margaritas or other tequila drinks instead of the sugar that comes with the other drinks  this one comes with salt i am not saying it s bad   for   calories  obviously they couldn t use sugar  but i just assumed they would be just like the other mixes but made with nutrisweet or something as long as you know what to expect   a much less sweet drink that goes better with tequila salt   then they are fine  of course  you can put whatever liquor you want in there  but i tried one with vodka and it just tasted odd to me here is exactly what the drinks are  mango skinny margarita  blood orange tequila sunrise  classic skinny margarita  strawberry tequila lemonade  acai blueberry skinny margarita this is a good product to acquire via commerce if you are desperate for a liquid to possess  it can be placed in a container  swallowing it is possible  it can go in your mouth region  alcohol is intended to go into it  and i personally recommend that you dilute these liquids with booze flavors  the boozeahol can help to momentarily distract you from the uncomfortable truth that the acai blueberry fluid tastes like you hijacked the smurfs  winnebago and put its tire in your mouth  all in all  these liquids do not contain dangerous solids which may choke you  so they successfully could be considered fluid  drink them  or else this drink is good im not a heavy drinker but a friend shared this drink with me and its light with a kick weekend to relax at home this review was collected as part of a promotion best margarita for summer with friends i was so glad that this product was available on line and the delivery so quick as i was able to take this mixer with me to share at a cottage  thank you  i will continue to purchase items on line  grab and go is super convenient great for entertaining  i always have this on hand in my freezer  makes an impressive drink by the pool i m a bartender  this stuff is good  try it  you will not regret it everything went as planed  no surprises  thank you had a pool party  the margaritas were a real hit cobblestone bread co  original english muffins are wonderful for breakfast sandwiches  toasted and spread with butter and drizzled with honey or jam  what can i say not enough for sure  you have to try them  maybe for lunch with chicken salad or a blt when tomatoes are ripe and juicy  any way  they are the best i like these better than thomas english muffins  the texture and pre slitting is better cobblestone english muffins  wheat   ct  are they  spose to be so doughy hard to slice  cuz the doughy inside balls up  taste very good   only after toasting till the edges burn these english muffins are very good and they are half the price of others i love the cobblestone original english muffins  being from new england  these are the type of english muffins i am used to  i don t like those other ones with the nooks and crannies  in new england  you can find this type in every grocery store  not necessarily the cobblestone brand  it s hard to find this type in the south  seems like they only sell thomas s which are gross  sometimes i can find these at food lion but my walmart doesn t even have a spot on the shelf this product is as good as if not better  stays fresher longer and their other products are very good as well bought these just to try them out  they were great  flavorful  crispy when lightly toasted  we will definitely buy them again first time trying these  really good great much better than the name brand doesn t have nooks and crannies but for the price i really enjoy them not soft like orowheat dry enough but not overpowering this chardonnay pairs great with all types of meals and also seems to appease all wine drinkers  good choice for large gatherings  great value and guests are happy with the quality this is my favorite brand and size i drink it instead of v  for breakfast  along with an occasional true bloody mary when i am entertaining friends  my only complaint is the delivery packaging of a pack of     the box was delivered upside down and was ripped   the contents  thankfully  were not damaged  it would help if the outer box was labeled this side up  i love this product and drink usually an   oz bottle daily with nothing in it but the mix  it is like snappy tom but i like it better  the last time i ordered a case of it and it is almost gone already  if you like a spicy tomato drink i highly recommend it i love this and drink it without alcohol every day  but  it is practically non existent in the stores  you can find bold spicy but not this  and why does this cost almost   more per bottle then the bold spicy hi  this is cocktail artist robert porter  first  i d like to thank you for taking the time to review my cocktail artist premium manhattan mix  i am totally humbled and very passionate about bringing you this remarkable product  what i ve done is take out the guess

julip  if your not a big fan whiskey  you can use this with other spirits  mix tequila with ca manhattan mix and our premium lime juice for a fine margarita  or make a dark and stormy using lite rum

can create  make the glass your canvas  mix it like you mean it  robert omg love  love the best cocktail mix ever  a must try for everyone  don t miss out although i don t feel it s necessary to describe how angels came down from heaven to squeeze tiny droplets of nirvana into a bottle to be sold across the country in retailers under this brand and recipe  i feel i will be expressing this to everyone i meet until the bitter end of my life  this mix  this powerful concoction of pure ecstasy   is unbelievably awesome and will likely turn me into a raging alcoholic passed out in a gutter occasionally coming to the surface to scream i need more as monkeys and degenerate courtesans frolic in my bodily fluids streaming from both ends  it s that freaking good folks  buy it  buy cases of it  snort it  drink it  shoot it  whatever you do   just try it  once you do you ll be on here leaving another depraved review  hopefully three times more twisted than mine  god speed  god speed after finding out that i was hosting an impromptu b day party for a friend i scrambled knowing that my beverage knowledge was very basic  limited to essentially beer  wine and liquor soda  further  i knew that i would soon host several liquor pros  including those that would size up my novice bartending abilities  enter the cocktail artist essential bar ingredients premium manhattan mix  making my pre shindig trip to walmart  i circled the aisles looking for something that could help me out  i came across a bottle of this liquid magic which allowed me to craft top notch manhattans  to this day  i still am asked by party patrons what was my secret recipe  go figure  if you need instant bartender credibility for your next soire  look no further than this life saver bought this on a whim last minute for a dinner party and was very pleasantly surprised    tried it with both bourbon  bulleit  and rye  rittenhouse  and both came out great  it has a nice citrusyness that brings all the flavors together quite nicely and it wasn t too sweet or syrupy or artificial tasting at all  loved this product and will definitely be making it a staple in my home bar can t wait to sample the other products in their line as well the best easiest manhatten ever  was such a great mix to have for our diy cocktail party  now it s always in our bar at home  sometimes you just need a fancy drink best cocktail product ever  my husband is a  yr career bartender this changed his game  it is now the staple of his bar  it s so smooth light  makes it impossible to have just  i m very impressed with the fact that this mannhattan mix represented by robert porter  has natural ingredients  and is not laden with fake chemicals  i prefer my drinks to taste real  fresh and balanced  and this mix is a lovely complement to my whiskey of choice  i highly recommend this mix this is amazing  i was shocked by how smooth  and tasty it was  usually i do not buy cocktail mixes but a friend recommended this one to me  and i am so glad she did  i love it  it will defiantly be a staple in my home and parties i have to say i never thought of buying a mix like this  but it is so tasty and delicious  all you have to do is add your favorite whiskey and some robert porter over ice  super easy manhattan and very smooth  and tastes amazing  highly recommended i wasn t too sure about this at first because it was so inexpensive but thought i d give it a shot  it far exceeded all expectations  so delicious and smooth  super impressed  plus it doesn t hurt that the guy on the bottle is cute just sayin this is a superb drink for those days you don t feel like getting dressed for that upscale bar downtown  invite a friend and share this cocktail at home  this is an elegant drink for those with a sophisticated palate  this cocktail will now be a staple in my home bar not personally into pre made mixes  but bought this for entertaining friends the other night  was extremely impressed  so smooth and balanced  everyone loved their manhattans  all you have to do is add your whiskey or bourbon of choice  there are no artificial flavors or high fructose corn syrups in the mix either  just pure cane sugar  honestly probably safer than using the liqueurs on the market  as a bartender myself i m telling you to get this product i used this manhattan mixer at our weekend pool party and it was an absolute hit  cocktails were delicious and simple to make  it was one of the conversational pieces of the party this is great stuff  i wasn t sure what to expect before trying it  because it s the first time i ve tried manhattan mix  it is so easy to make and even easier to drink  delicious  smooth  wonderful on the palette  next time i m in i m going to buy   of them  and also get some for my friends  great stuff  please keep this in stock love this  great product  prefect for parties  graduation  summer bbq s it s a full bodied and delicious  i use it at get together or just when i m needing that manhattan at home after work i am a fan of the manhattan  although rarely do i buy a mix  however i decided to give this a try  the price couldn t be beat  smooth taste  authentic to a true manhattan  just follow the directions on the bottle  simple as that  it s a great tasting mixer  in a good size bottle at a good price this was the best buy the manhattan was perfect   tasty  and smooth  i was at a party and first tried the drink and went out and purchased for my party coming up  i had to share i think people will love love it great tasting fool proof mix served in a very stylish bottle this is so delicious  you can actually make a perfect tasting  smooth manhattan like a pro  great product had this for a party last night it was a hit  fantastic mix  whoever put this together knows their stuff  highly recommended what an amazing product  absolutely love it this product is so simple and easy to use   i ve tried different manhatan mixes before and this one is by far my favorite  it meshes very well w any burbon and the flavors don t overpower and try to mask the burbon like other products   it s an essential to my mini bar at home  amazing product i have a manhattan almost everyday after work  my wife bought me this to try and although it is decent  it is not necessary  spend your money on quality vermouth and of course the best bourbon one can afford i ve already went through   bottles of this stuff  great tasting and smooth  and so easy to make my favorite drink  a manhattan  definitely recommend this as a premium mixer a must for every home bar  how easy can it get amazing product  it make making a cocktail easy and tastes great so good  it really makes having a craft cocktail at home really easy  it is so hard to find natural products these days  especially mixers  i really love this one  the taste is excellent  i m going to try some of the other mixers now too  this one is definitely my new favorite mixer i love this mix  it s easy and taste delicious after tasting the smooth flavor of this mix  i discovered a more natural way to enjoy a manhattan this mix was the star of the party  we could not make it fast enough for the guest to drink although this is a manhattan mix  i love to add it to many of my cocktails  the flavors are so complex  they elevate the flavor profile of my concoctions it was a little tart but i like that what a great mix  makes an excellent margarita  just add tequila very small amount for the price  won t make this mistake again this is the bomb sweet then hits you like fire good spice and a cool label on the bottle very poor packaging  wrapping and shipping  two of three bottles were broke on arrival  if you love grape juice with a twist  this is a must try everything is great about this product  cheap price  perfect taste  mixing this flavor with just a soda makes it delicious i m a single malt scotch guy  i generally have two fingers neat with a quality cigar about once a week  on a stressful day  i ll have a couple of beers or so after work before the family gets home  the trouble is the beer gut that comes with that trend  i was looking for something similar to my favorite scotch  which is a little out of my budget to drink daily  jim beam black is an awesome substitute with the rich white oak aroma and flavor  it isn t near as smooth as my favorite scotch  but the flavor is on point  thank you jim beam for putting this great whiskey out there at an affordable price  you ve got a customer for life exceptionally good flavor no matter where i go after years of various bourbon tastings jim beam black is head and shoulders above the rest no matter what the price tag i m personally a wild turkey drinker  but cudos to jim beam for producing such a classy commercial  got the right girl to be their spokesperson  good job  very classy seriously you ask what s great about it what isn t great about it no explanation necessary i first started drinking jim bean when i went camping  i didnt want to carry the bear around so i tried jim bean  my first was red stag cherry  than i tried devils cut when i came home  i have been hooked ever since  i usually mix with coke or dr pepper this is the best bourbon under   you can buy  one of the smoothest bourbons i ve tasted  i typically drink woodford reserve or eagle rare until i tried this  i buy a bottle every two weeks now this is beam at it s best very smooth i tried jb black for the first time tonight  it is so smooth  we made whiskey sours with it and they were awesome  thanks jim beam for this awesome bourbon i have been enjoying jb black for the past three years  the has all the flavor os a higher proof  bur   i can have another without collapsing  now it has disappeared from even the most extensive liquor stores in my area  what happened the double oaked is ok  but no match for the black  where can i find it in sonoma county  california i bought this in early december and it didn t make it to the new year  this one is awesome  keep up the great work absolutely love  love  love it i really like how compact and easy to use this pressure washer is  would buy it again in an instant after using it first off its not as powerful as the gas model i had but its not as bad as the other reviews describe  my gas model would peel paint  this one is not that strong  if you need something to wash and clean  it works fine on concrete and dirt  if you need to peel paint  get a gas one i was lucky to purchase this power washer on sale for     my patio and porch look like new  my drive way and sidewalks look new as well  i decided to power wash my house too  all with just water  everything done in about   hours  easy to use  great investment great review  barbecue pits are next i used this a lot to clean my wheel wells on my truck of road pack and the underside of my riding mower  i was disappointed to see that after only   years of use my pump developed a leak which would cost more to fix than than buying a new unit  i am retired and can t afford to buy one every   years but it looks like i will if you re going to take the time a pressure wash your driveway or your house  this is not worth the time or effort  the nozzle is so small and the actual dirt that comes off is the same amount from a normal hose i also got this during sam s spring sale  having messed with my father s   year old electric pressure washer  i didn t have high hopes  i was looking for something inexpensive that would clean my driveway  grill and fence every so often  yes  gas models are more powerful  but they re more expensive and you need to maintain them  first off   the build quality  seems rugged  metal couplings for hoses  vs plastic for my dad s old one  how well it does  concrete was cleaned  the big circle washer does an ok job  but the turbo washer really gets it done  see photo  the big circle washer would be good for maintaining  not for a deep clean  also had no issues cleaning my grill from   years of grease  overall with a   year warranty i m pretty happy with this bought  assembled  and used it to clean concrete with mold  mildew  and moss on it  worked great i got this to do a power washing job  and i love it  it s small yet powerful comes with a variety of different accessories that you would end up paying more money for sam s club is   percent pleasing with its all of its sales products  everything from electrical  electronic  groceries  furniture  building products  recreational and mechanical etc  my black max pressure washer gets five stars and the sales price was the best  i recommended that my youngest son purchase one and he loves it too  thanks  sams club great electric pressure washer  the scrubber worked great on my patio i purchased an electric model just to avoid another gas engine  this model works good cleaning our patio aggregate steps  walk driveway  it s light weight  easy to store priced accordingly i m a woman who doesn t like to wait for her husband to help her do something  i can operate this by myself  i was surprised at how nicely it cleaned our composite decking  our   year oldcement steps had green moss and black stains and i was able to clean they also  i used scott s outdoor soap and can easily attach different nozzles and attachments  i hated our our gas power washer and we had much trouble with it  i hope this one lasts as it is a good value i bought this article on sale and was a good deal it doesn t has a lot of power but works i did purchase this pressure washer about a month ago and just used it  i am very happy with it  i got a lot of bang for my buck  i really like it for its size works good  have two gas ones but can t use inside due to fumes  this electric one does the job great price works great does what i need it to do  great attachments  not as powerful as gas powered but knew that before purchase nice machine   it s slower than a gas machine but it gets the job done i have used the black max pressure washer countless times since it arrived  i was able to clean green moss type mold from between the clay bricks in my courtyard that has been there for years  this piece of equipment is very easy to handle  even for a small person such as myself  i love my pressure washer had a gas pressure washer  worked well for a couple of years  with some minor repairs  then finally went kaput  only need it for light cleaning  this one started without problem  and did the job it was intended for  and it was reasonably priced bought last year and used once  not strong enough to do much more than wash your car  sprayer is plastic and not rugged  sprayer ailed on me this year  internal components rusted even though the washer was drained  threaded connection to the sprayer is plastic  cheaply made  now junkyard schweppes makes a good diet tonic  i prefer canada dry only because it seems to hold the fizz longer  i don t drink generic  i have not found any of the off brands that taste good compared to schweppes and canada dry  please don t stop carrying or even add canada dry  the only other thing i suggest is to stock more on the shelves as most of the time there is maybe one or two on the shelf  sartell walmart if you drink tonic water  this one is the best tasting and it is great that walmart now has it available and will ship it to your home  i hope they continue this the product advertise said  pk  i have no idea what that means but i assumed it was going to be   pack   it turned out to be one bottle for     less expensive to buy at the store  it does not make any sense great taste i have been trying to cut back on sugar and found this has the best taste   i compared canada dry polar walmart   but i can t find in smaller bottle or cans great product and will purchase again schweppes tonic is the best there is because it doesn t lose it s fizz and always has a great refreshing taste it was just ok  i will buy it only if you guys run out of your great value diet tonic water   because i have to have the diet  schweppes just doesn t have the flavor nor does it it hold its carbonation like the great value brand does this is a rich and delicious red wineblend that many will enjoy  its full of dark fruit flavors and zinfindel  the best red blend that i have ever had it s delish  the only suggestion i have is to sell a bigger bottle with a handle i love everything about jim beam apple  the taste is great and it goes down smooth  it s one of the best drinks out there with or without any added mixes i was hesitant to buy jim beam apple  after trying other apple whiskeys  but i was not disappointed  it s so smooth  light and fruity  very good very smooth  but very sweet  i would like to know how much sugar is added i mix the jim beam apple with a little ginger ale  it is a great summer refreshment it makes the greatest apple bourbon martini outstanding  smooth  easy to drink the apple jim beam is the bomb it s smooth no chaser needed i am hooked this is a great tasting refreshing drink just as good as any good bar bloody mary if you are trying to save calories and still have a tasty margarita this mix is great  use a few drops of essential lime oil to give a more natural taste though my wife loves margaritas  and  i have always struggled with how to make the perfect margarita  but  along comes jose cuervo classic lime light margarita mix and l feel like a pro  with zero calories zero carbs and zero sugars  the only calories  sugars  are from the alcohol  this mix is the best  here s my formula      parts mix     part tequila  i love logado from total wine      to   teaspoons of artificial sweetner   a big splash of gran gala liquer  the drink should become a light amber color      fresh lime juice mix well and add crushed ice  voila taste great  but never enough in stock at the stores i have been buying this for years  tastes like homemade without calories  not as sweet as other mixes love the taste  very good good refreshing drink and taste great with taco dip  a true summer treat tastes great this is a great product to beat the gain weight vs  no cold margaritas in the summer battle   good flavor and no calories  i usually squeeze a lime into the pitcher and they taste great  low price great taste tastes great it s a good tasting low cal mixer  you do not have to buy expensive tequila for it to taste good i didn t like this product when compared to master of mixes lite  jose cuervo seemed flat with little or no tartness  and tasted artificial  don t believe it contains any real lime juice if the mouth of the bottle was bigger it would make it easier to get the product out after putting in the freezer  i m sure other people do this making large batches  once the tequila is mixed in  the mix melts quickly so placing in the freezer would speed up the process if you could then get it out  why only   stars since i started using this product cant hardly drink a margarita made with high calorie mixers  fortunately more folks in my walmart area are also starting to use and now our local walmart rarely doesn t have it i cannot find this in the stores  so glad jet has it  this review was collected as part of a promotion my husband and i love the unique taste of this margarita mix  jet was the only place that offered this mix at a grate price  the delivery was fast  we will continue to order from jet  this review was collected as part of a promotion add tequila or just seltzer and a slice of fresh lime to make a virgin margarita  it s great both ways  perfect for summer entertaining  sweepstakes this review was collected as part of a promotion by far the best mixer i have had the pleasure of tasting  perfectly balanced sweet  tart  and citrus notes  it was so popular at a gathering that it didn t last past   minutes excellent taste  no high fructose corn syrup im a very picky margarita drinker  i always make my own lime juice mix  but i decided to give this a try  and to tell you the truth  the margaritas were awesome  not too sweet not to tart taste really good  i would buy again to make large batches some of the best tasting margarita mix i have used  highly recommend this is the best margarita mix   not too sweet  everytime i host a party i serve this and people love my margaritas bought this for my parents  they said it was awful and tasted very chemical  they love margaritas  so i bought this after reading reviews  won t do that again we bought our first bottle of powell mahoney margarita mix locally and decided it was the very best mix we ever had  hard to find in local shops  glad we found it on amazon  all natural ingredients and hand crafted this is an excellent pre made mixer  without artificial taste  however  it is available in my grocery store for about half this price tastes pretty good but you pay for it  too lazy to make my own mix fresh this margarita mix tastes soooo good   it s not too sweet unlike other brands  you don t need to add anything  just your tequila of choice and you re good to go one of the best but it takes to long to get great natural margarita mix great margarita mix ad service very good mix great margarita don t waste your money  over rated  over priced  you could make your own by looking up an online recipe and wouldn t be able to tell the difference do you love margaritas they are among the most popular adult beverages in america and many people rank them as their favorite alcoholic beverage of all  the right tequila can make a noticeable difference when mixing up a margarita  but the right mixer is important as well  and one of the best mixers available is power mahoney margarita i just got to know powell mahoney recently and i have been singing its praises ever since  this mix is every bit as delicious as the others in the powell mahoney lineup thanks in no small part to the all  natural ingredients used in the process  have you taken a good look at the ingredients used in other mixers they re enough to make even the most tolerant person cringe  even a really good tequila often cannot mask the taste of a bad mixer and i can think of many mixed drinks that i could barely finish due to a less than pleasant mixer base with powell mahnoey margarita mixer  you get the great  natural taste you desire with a good balance between the sweet and the sour  pour a little into a glass and taste it all by itself  you will notice flavors of lime and a little bit of orange with an overall taste that leans toward the sour side but one that seems just right to match with a fine tequila  the taste is even good enough that some people might enjoy this mixer served with non  alcoholic combinations like soda water and even on the rocks with nothing added margaritas are popular drinks but even your favorite drink can lose its appeal if it contains a weak ingredient  with powell mahoney margarita mixer  you get the great  natural  fresh citrus flavor that makes for the perfect mixed drink  buy a bottle from this vermont  based company and fall in love with your margarita  all over again excellent flavor  not at all sweet syrupy like other mixes yum  over shaved ice with a lime wedge  it arrived so quickly to boot fantastic  from the  s to the  st century  try it in the drinks and mixtures  it works  this is tge best bittera for tiki drinks you can get  it gives them that extra bust yoy need to make it over the top to the people who don t think things like bitters and muddled fruit don t make any difference in a drink  they couldn t be more wrong  this habenero shrub bitter adds a real dimension to the cocktail and anyone serious about their drink should have this love this product we ve been using it almost nightly to make cocktails love these bitters  a small drop in bourbon or vodka really transforms the spirit the perfect accompaniment to any bourbon drink this stuff rocks  use it for one of the employees only bar cocktail recipes awesome and prompt shipping great selection of different flavors for a starter set the perfect touch  with a good punch of heat a wonderful flavor filled bitters  it appears to be made for beach drinks with rum  but i love using it in my manhattans  i ve also added it to apples sauteed in butter and brown sugar  yum great flavor and perfect for my winter drinks yummy  in my gin drinks or just with seltzer these were bomb diggity perfect for my use i bought the bittermen s hopped grapefruit bitters for my sister and brother in law as a christmas gift  i haven t tried the product myself  but they have been raving about how nicely the bitters enhance a gin and tonic or a reposado cocktail used them to make just a few of these fine cocktails margie has some spice the mezcal fizz and the mexican firing squad and they were perfect purchased as a gift and recipient loved it for his old fashions bittermens bitters are the bomb  every home bar needs a few of these on hand this is extremely spicy with ginger  not so much gingerbread flavor  as i hoped for i m thinking of blending it with other bitters to achieve more of a gingerbread flavor the mole bitters are delicious delicious bitters  really completes my oaxacan old fashioneds  wish it came in a smaller quantity for a more affordable price  it ll be years before i have to buy another one of these i love spicy foods  and this provides a great twist on an old fashioned  love it great product some of my favorite bitters ever  great unique flavor  now if they just weren t so darn expensive we ordered this to add to a collection of bitters for making old fashions  i was afraid it might be too spicy but it created a lovely addition with a hint of chocolate and spice great for jazzy up my tiki cocktails great for gin drinks great to make spicy drinks delicious  deep flavor that is unlike any bitters i ve tried love this  perfect to add a little heat to your cocktail must use a lot as it wasn t that strong excellent ingredient to make a bayshore sunrise cocktail this stuff is magic if you love spicy shrubby  makes my manhattans sooo good with a high quality vermouth amazing   thank you did not like the flavor of these pleased with purchase i love it with iced coffee  cream  and honey fantastic stuff great supplement to cocktails delicious    squirts from the eye dropper in   liter of sparking water for a great orange water cheaper than buying cans if you use a soda maker these are delicious  they will take any fruity tropical drink to the next dimension with a subtle spiced layer  cuts the sweetness and adds depth these sounded better than they ended up being  i found them to be a little too bitter and tart for an old fashioned  now i love cranberries  and understand how tart real ones are but in a drink i do not really want to be a purist  i want great taste  i will try adding a bit more sugar to my drink  but i doubt it will make mush of an impact  bottom line is  ok  but not great great for negroni i like to add a few drops of this to my scotch on those occasions when i cant afford my favorite islay single malt tiki bitters makes an for an excellent sharpie mustache and i will experiment more with them for other tropical coctails as well  the packaging is nice i like the dropper  is only reason for   stars i had this in a cocktail i had in a restaurant  good purchase  i haven t tried it in anything else yet delicious and hard to get more than a whisper out at one time good for cocktails great bitters  love all their products a very well received gift i have several of their bitters now and use them both when the occasion presents itself  i really like a few drops of the xocolati bitters in a good negroni  it adds a whole new layer of complexity  i am looking forward to trying the elemakule tiki bitters  since i ve just gotten interested in making tiki drinks i also really like their hopped grapefruit bitters  really nice in a good gt great for bloody mary s wow  what a great addition for anyone who makes tiki drinks  goes perfectly not only with rum  but tangueray  throw out the skunk flavored angostura bitters  this is the perfect compliment to most tiki drinks and especially anything you make with don s mix  thank you bittermens  now you need to get this stuff on the store shelves delicious addition to rye and water oh my gosh  this is so delicious  i ve only used it so far in cocktails but have received so many compliments on it  friends have asked what s in this drink  it s so delicious  i actually bought a few other flavors to give as a gift we make a burlesque martini with fresh rosemary with this at our bar  it s very tasty this is my favorite bartender s favorite bitters   nough said something for every bar man home or professional  essential mixology  and the fusion of alcohol with fine cuisine the best does not taste like habaneros what so ever  very disappointing  not to mention you have to pour half the bottle in your tiny drink to taste it the  burlesque  has a distinctive central flavor   i think it s walnut husk  aromatic and bitter in itself  and easy to pair with warm flavors  i like that taste  having done some experiments based on the parsons book  and find it uncommon among the commercial bitters i ve tried but  i have to say  i still prefer my own walnut based flavors  this comes on strong with the central flavor and enticing bitterness  but lacks the secondary and tertiary notes that make a flavor memorable  so  it s good  if i didn t make my own  very good   it would be a regular on my shelf  recommended  unless you make your own  wiredweirdps  i m not a fan of dropper bottles  and this comes with a medicine dropper  perhaps you get more repeatability and precision with a dropper  until the bottle runs low  but i prefer the convenience of a shaker  which you can find easily at amazon enhanced our beverage perfectly a fun bitter to experiment with your drinks  tastes great this product is fantastic  and i haven t yet found anything that can really take its place  when i got it  i took out the dropper and dripped a little right on my tongue and instantly fell in love  it has the depth and complexity of flavor you expect from bitters  but it s not overwhelming  i love a glass of rum with just a couple dashes of this in it  or in an east india trading co  cocktail  with rum  sherry and amaro liqueur  i highly recommend add as a wonderful surprise to bloody mary s or over pepper vodka on the rocks  try on steak or chicken on the grill only used these bitters twice but each time they ve been outstanding  definitely necessary if you find a drink you want to make with them  nothing else would replace them this is specifically for the xocolatl mole bitters as amazon seems to have lumped all the reviews together  tasted in person at a bitters bar at oxbow market in napa and was excited to find easily on amazon  a few drops in any tequila drink makes me happy   just a subtle hint of chocolate and heat  as i often use bitter sour mixers less is more  or else it pushes the drink way too bitter  will definitely buy again if i ever finish the bottle i have   a little goes a long way is ok need more intense on flavor what great bitters  with a bit of searching  one can find a host of creative cocktails to use the bitters for  highly recommended the mole flavor is so rich and lingering  it is balanced perfectly with its bitter quality  i cannot imagine drinking a tiki  slide  cocoa  or a runner without a splash of this in it  amazing great for a mole margarita like tommy bahamas makes only knock is for the actual taste which is not quite orange cream but a vanilla vinegar orange rhine sort of taste  depends on what you re going for in taste profile as i can see this easily matching some others  preferences for mixed drinks these bitters taste great and last a long time  a perfect addition to a manhattan or old fashioned  product arrived in perfect condition and on time dump the plastic dropper rod attached to the cap immediately on receipt it pulls right off  whether or not you like the taste of the product  i was pleased enough  the  inch plastic dropper rod  while very handy for adding drops of the bitters to one s drink in a measured manner  is made from an extremely foul source discovered this after having finished off a bottle of bittermen s grapefruit bitters and leaving it on the shelf for a month  then opened up the bottle to add some gin and absorb the remains of the bitters to the quite empty bottle  an extremely foul toxic smell emerged immediately investigating  i found it to unmistakably be the plastic dropper rod attached to the bottle cap  while immersed in the strong smelling and  tasting bitters solution  it s disguised  when not  well    it is just revolting  try it see for yourself no one should be ingesting any substance steeped in this material  bittermen s  you really gotta clean up your act with that dropper rod just a friendly reminder  shrub bitters are bitters that contain lots of vinegar  if the thought of drinking a bottle of vinegar sounds appealing to you  then you may enjoy this  if it doesn t  then you do not want these   take a whiff and it smells like someone dying easter eggs   if you want a spicy bitter that s not a shrub  try scrappy s habanero firewater bitters instead delicious bitters  great addition to any cocktail great they smell fantastic  i haven t tried them myself yet  but they smell like heaven and i ve been informed they taste good  too  bottle is sturdy and doesn t leak  dropper works well and doesn t drip much  so it s easy to transfer to drink cleanly tasty stuff  hop and grapefruit flavors are nicely balance  good for cocktails that would benefit from some sharp  high flavor notes i ve tried this in a few drinks so far and none have turned out tasting any good i wrote to the company and asked if they had any suggestions for using it but they never responded probably will just sit on the shelf now until i get tired of seeing it and toss it i ve had this for about   weeks now and i can t seem to find too many uses for it  great in gin martini type drinks and mellows out some harsher spirits in cocktails  otherwise i can t really find too many recipes online or uses for it  shipping and packaging is excellent i bought this for one specific purpose   as an ingredient for a cocktail called carter beats the devil       and  it works great  it s not quite as prominent of an ingredient as the chili tincture that the restaurant in san francisco used  but it does the job   just wish it had more punch per drop i ve used it quite a bit   and  since it is measured in drops  it ll probably last me forever i am interested now in trying more of bittermens bitters       glad i bought this one i love all sorts of bitters  but this one is a favorite of mine  it has a complex flavor with hints of cardamom and clove and also exotic fruits  i like it in grapefruit  gin and sodas  and also in jack and cokes  makes a great manhattan bittermens xocolatl mole bitters add a complex note to manhattans other cocktails  very full flavored  rich undertone  we love it perfect for the carter beats the devil cocktail  an invention of flora in oakland    drops go a very long way the tear dropper is a bit confusing your first time  but these are simply delicious  the aroma hits you right off the bat when you open the bottle  the aromatic hops go wonderfully with grapefruit  and these bitters are awesome in a sawyer  mojito  or daiquiri  it is a strange combination  but it really works  try these my husband is a tequila officianado and was delighted to find these bitters on amazon com he immediately ordered them and enjoys a drop in his tequila on the rocks every evening great product good bitters with rye whiskey and punt e mes vermouth  drink responsibly  as a matter of fact do everything responsibly fantastic  came quickly  love love love  makes great cocktails  would recommend to anyone  thank you so much bitter mans  you are great on the advice of a highly knowledgeable relative  i bought this as a stocking stuffer for another family member  it was a big hit  and i must say  very interesting addition to a cocktail  now i need some thanks it s ok i love these bitters  you get what you pay for  and while this product is pricey it is also delicious if you miss dr  brown s cel ray soda  use this to make your own interesting addition to latin based cocktails  saves me preparing the shrub it myself thanks great signature flavors and aromas beautifully aromatic  this is great for adding subtle hints of citrus and vanilla to any cocktail or dessert interesting flavor to add to summer refreshments  not too spicy it is just perfect  experiment to fit your taste i love chocolate bitters in a manhattan  the full flavor of these bitters balances nicely with the richness of carpano antica not everything does and you need a rye with some kick to bring it all together this stuff has just the right amount of heat   enough to be worth using  but not so much that you can make your cocktails undrinkable without effort  i put it in any cocktail that needs a little bite  and have been happy with the results not wanting alcohol on an outing with colleagues but wanting something that has taste  i ordered club soda with bitters  it was a well sorted bar  and the bar tender gave me the choice  loving anything spicy  i tried the hellfire and it was so wonderful that i had to order a bottle to greet me when i get home two drops in a gin vermouth martini is just about perfect  good stuff  luckily  it comes with a dropper i ve put it in my manhattans and martinis  super delicious  i can t wait to try it in other drinks  i ve used   drops per drink for a little kick on the back end this doesnt put out the heat i wanted  to get a good bite you add so much it effects the flavor of the drink it s not terrible  but a chopped jalapeo can get just as much if not more heat   with a better flavor while bittermens primarily makes various kinds of bitters for making drinks   this one is not technically bitters  but a tart shrub   especially good for adding to bloody marys  and an amazing bloody shrimp martini  i m sure you could make a good drink in the traditional shrub recipes   but a dropper of this really brightens up even the most plain jane bloody recipe with a shot of liquid celery flavor  love it these are an interesting addition to a bitters collection  excellent in rum drinks  very pleased and would definitely recommend if you mix up cocktails which i make  and enjoy  and i am totally not an alcoholic just because i have an adult beverage once or twice a week  with some bitters in it mixology has become a passion of mine i m known in my friend circle for making gfc s  good f n cocktails  bittermens hellfire is one of my secret ingredients  it adds just the right subtle heat to anything i make i ve carefully selected over a dozen really top notch hand crafted bitters to add just the right extra something to my cocktails  these folks have created one of the very best bitters out there   thank you adds great flavor to any beverage  i suggest trying it with vodka or gin  looking forward to using it in a drink with dark liqueur so the habanero bitters are great in a version of a margarita we do that traditionally used tabasco  i like this at least as much and you don t get any of the vinegar flavor one does from tabasco also  love the tiki bitters and a bitter monk is my new favorite cocktail just because i get to use this in it great stuff these bitters are great and the dropper bottle is an easy way to use th estuff in all kinds of cocktails  my only complaint was that the boston bitahs leaked in transit  so the entire box smelled  great  and i only have about   of the bottle remaining  still  that was one bottle out of an order of   so i m not complaining i use these in all kinds of tiki drinks and they are really great   they have lots of warm spice notes and lend an exotic flavor to rum based drinks  i would say there is a strong nutmeg note here which can put some folks off  but i m a huge fan personally  it s tough to find bitters that work in tiki drinks beyond angostura  so this is a great addition to the bar for people that make a lot of tropical themed cocktails i was at the kentucky bourbon mixology competition recently and all the bartenders were making spicy flavored drinks  i looked all around for this stuff and finely ordered it here my first cocktail was great  oz  rye whiskey  or bourbon  oz  simple syrup  lemon twist  dashes of peychaud s bitters  drops of bittermens habanero bitters  start with   and increase from there  it gets hot serve it on ice this was out of stock almost everywhere and i nabbed the last one on amazon  it was part of a gift for my boyfriend for his new bar set  the something extra after the staples of regan s  angostura  and peychauds  and the smallest and most expensive bottle of the group  it has been worth every penny   complex  flavorful  rich  not overly sweet  a real winner  the bittermens website has some wonderful recipes  but we have been most enjoying it so far with a large rock    shots  a dash of regan s    drops or so of this one and a splash each of lemon and soda water this will spice up your average cocktail and turn it into a signature cocktail  i bet you ll enjoy it too subtle and slow building great with citrus and flavorful bases  like anejo tequila  gin  or golden rum bittermens makes some of the most unique bitters i mentioned to the bar tender that the secret ingredient in a mojito was a couple of drops of bitters  he did not have the angostura bitters so we tried the bittermens hopped grapefruit bitters  all i can say is ay  caramba the bitters gave the mojito a very refreshing taste this flavor of bitters is quite unique  there is a subtle warmth and profound chocolate flavor that is haunting  we like it in a tequila based coffee liqueur  add half a shot of good scotch and you have a drink worthy of the finest company you know for any tikiphile out there  these are a great addition to any tropical drink recipes  i substitute them in place of angostura bitters in zombies  rum barrels and   swizzles  they may be a bit niche in their application  but it s a wonderful product nonetheless one of the best tasting mix this is by far the best spicy mix on the market  you can almost eat it good product selection  priced right  had delivery issues good thanks excellent prices  but after a week and a half of hearing nothing i called to find out that my item  the customer service rep said it had been back ordered and i would receive an email once it shipped my item arrived the next day and i received the shipping email four days later  no big deal just takes a while to get items  but you cannot beat the prices easy to find item i wanted and at a good price easy process really good  the right battery for my motorcycle fast service and great prices  knowledgable sales persons  hugh in stock items  packing was excellent  doubled boxed easy to navigate website and easy to order process great job very easy and convenient i purchased for an island oasis machine  these work perfectly and taste great i love mango everything  i don t like pure sugar  this is so very thick sweet even if i try it in a frozen margarita  i am sticking with the citrus one it was so tasty  the bottle was gone way too early love the taste and texture  taste great mixed with the watermelon as well i love this flavor of mixer  my granddaughter even loves the smoothies i make for her  i mix fruit juice and mango daiquir mixer with ice   excellent summer drink  really hope walmart continues to sell this product  easy to order and fast delivery m mix this with ice tequila and lime than once serve top it of with chamoy my sister and i really enjoyed the flavor of this mix  it was truly like biting into a mango taste delicious  i even mixed with the ststrawberry follow directions  no more   no less  perfect a little thick but taste great this bitters taste good  but i knocked a star off because the artificial coloring in it stains surfaces  it s not a deal breaker  but i wish they didn t add the fake coloring great for old fashions it s one of the main ingradients in a  old fashion  very tasty good product  the small bottle goes a long way  too just what i expected good product great turn around and it is exactly the way i expected it works excellent as always this was exactly what i expected and it arrived quite quickly exactly what s needed for my favorite cocktail  whiskey sour i am a whiskey sour lover  but imbibing only when out to dinner  hubby suggested trying home  i was so happy to find this product my walmart supercenter  first  it s taste is great  not much difference in taste from mr  and mrs  t s  which is slightly higher in price  prior to purchasing walmart  wasn t aware they carried mixers   foolish on my part   duh  they have everything  i was paying like   to   per bottle other stores  at walmart  believe it or not  it is  so i stocked up bought   bottles  they also have it in a lite version sugar free and i thought that would be great not so  i drink suger free pop  but this doesn t taste as good in the sugar free version  so tomorrow i am going to exchange   of the bottles for the regular type  hey  a few carbs here and there oh well  love walmart  i especially love that you have the ability to check the availability of the product online before treking out  especially since the mixer is pretty much only sold the supercenters  and we have   within a   mile radius but only one has it fantastic   especially mixed with amaretto best mix i have ever purchased i buy it regularly love this mix i love the flavor and taste  great for amaretto sour i was happy with the price  i haven t used it yet good for mixing cocktails  a little more sour than other brands  but not bad the white label or the devil s cut dashed with some lemonade and lime cordial is how i enjoy my jim best drink you can get to make manhattens best bourbon i have found have toured distillery and love the brand red stag and coke zero is my go to drink  only wish more bars and restaurants stocked it  nothing like a good bourbon with a cherry kick  i like it with dr peper to sip and relax better than the other s drank it for years and always smooth and tasty  now it is running off the shelves at our liquor store i keep jim beam on hand every day of the week i typically have this neat or with an ice cube  its light amber appearance  sweet  woody  mossy nose  and its mild moss  white oak  mellow wintergreen mint  and dried  faintly candied fruit flavor draws the drinker into an exploration of pin point distilling execution  jim beam original has a gradual finish  with a ghost of chocolate powder  during the fade out  highly recommended  rjt it s does have a great toaste to it the only drink i ll drink i had a neat   finger glass two weeks ago of jb black label for the first time  i ve always drank jack daniels  and i loved it  no more jack for me best tasteing and defenetly the smoothest around i love it i always keep a bottle of jim bean in my liquor cabinet  value for price is incredible and it mixes great when it comes to making perfect margarita s  sauza signature blue  my go to tequila  anchor hocking     oz  goblet  frozen with a margarita salt rim  it doesn t get any better let s face it  distilled alcohol products aren t health foods  but clear liquor products  vodka  gin  white rum  and silver tequila  contain less toxic wood solute byproducts  tannins and formaldehydes  than heavily aged  dark  liquors  science aside  sauza signature silver is a splendid treat and delightful to sip  the clean  crisp agave taste that makes tequila so special is front and center without the woody heaviness of darker tequilas  tequila is an acquired taste  and sauza signature blue is a taste worth acquiring a taste to be savored great mixed or on the rocks one of my go to chardonnay wines for every day enjoyment  sam s has this well priced this is my all time favorite wine  but i can not find it all the time  and only in one store  would be great to be able to buy more than one at a time too  hard to find the bigger bottle more than once a month  and rare in blackberry most are concord    good too  i would love to be able to find this item in all of my local walmarts the whipped creme flavored vodka is fabulous  i keep it in the freezer and have a snifter of it when i want something smooth after dinner or as a night cap  love it i love this vodka  i have been drinking vodka for many years  and this is by far one of the best  and my favorite vodka  i drink it regularly  usually with grape juice  but also with orange juice  we use it to make daiquiris  and many other frozen concoctions with real coconut water or on the rocks  hard to find  love it a sweet smooth taste in every drop it s delish  the only suggestion i have is to sell a bigger bottle with a handle i love everything about jim beam apple  the taste is great and it goes down smooth  it s one of the best drinks out there with or without any added mixes i was hesitant to buy jim beam apple  after trying other apple whiskeys  but i was not disappointed  it s so smooth  light and fruity  very good very smooth  but very sweet  i would like to know how much sugar is added i mix the jim beam apple with a little ginger ale  it is a great summer refreshment it makes the greatest apple bourbon martini outstanding  smooth  easy to drink the apple jim beam is the bomb it s smooth no chaser needed i am hooked this is a great tasting refreshing drink great taste  great color  this is the only mixer i ll use this margarita mixer is standard for mixing good drinks if you mix per the directions it makes a great margarita by far the best mix out there for classic margaritas to enjoy during the summer months not too sweet or tart  makes the best margarita we ve had this is a wonderful change of pace if you like margaritas  you will not be sorry you ve given it a try i bought this for an afternoon with friends and it was super refreshing  really liked the quality of the mix make sure you use crushed ice  little to sweet on the rocks new flavor same great product pretty good for a quickie not as tasty as fresh made but still tasty and very convenient to have in your pantry especially with the holidays coming up cheapest price on the internet and with free shipping you can t go wrong great price for a great beer  ordered online  then picked it right up i usually make my own cosmos  but thought is would be quicker to use a mix  bad idea  this particular flavor was soooo sweet  i had to keep adding lime to it to temper the sicky sweetness  if you like sweet then this is for you  does not taste like a true cosmo with their recipe lucky tasty and convenient to have on hand  not as good as fresh juice but still pretty good this chalk is nice and sturdy  even for a rowdy   year old these chalk are cheap but i guess you get what you pay for because they don t write well   this is  by far  the best tasting mango margarita mix on the market  perfect for on the rocks  all other brands are thick almost like a puree  which is not good for a margarita on the rocks  that stuff is more for frozen daiquiris  this is the same consistency as any regular margarita mix  perfect we love it but can t seem to find anywhere my wife was tickled to death to find it i really enjoyed its taste and price  best mixer i have ever tasted i m hooked on the mango flavor of master of mixes  i love to put the mix in a blender and mix it with ice for a cold smoothie summer drink  i love the strawberry flavor too  anyone who like icy s would love the mango flavor of master of mixes as well as the other flavors also this is a great supplement to non alcoholic drinks  i e  green tea  my store quit having it available  however  i found it online here  great for entertaining and adding to punch  a little goes a long way very good product  a little disappointed in the price  much higher than in the store nice to have shopping payment options with great prices pretty good app  linked me to my other apps no punching in all your info over and over  quick n easy easy process was alright not much detail about item ease of use website i like that i could use my amazon account great easy to use quick and easy it was very easy  i am looking forward to seeing it  it s for my granddaughters truck very easy  tried o reilly s and that was a pain  i m ordering from australia quick and easy really helps get my digestion going in the mornings these were prefect additions to small stalking stuffer christmas gifts for fellow nurse s at work  just add a nip of choice i haven t tried the product yet  i bought these as part of some end of year gifts we are doing for our teachers  i m planning on setting them out and teachers can choose the one that they want  i didn t realize that each bottle is not individually labeled  instead  the labeling of the flavor and directions for mixing are on the outside of the box  now  i have to make labels for each bottle before i give them out my hubby loves this and wants to always have it on hand when my girlfriends come over yeah delicious we have fallen in love with this bread  it reminds us of the great sourdough breads we used to buy in san fransisco  it has the most incredible  rich  delicious sourdough flavor as well as the perfect texture  we stock up on it every time we can find it on the shelf at walmart  but it s not always there  please make this a regular item that is always in stock  there is no other bread that comes close to the quality of this one for the value its really good light and and just a little bitter sweet will buy again they are as good as pillsbury but cheaper they work perfectly for my homemade donuts good taste great cooks simple also awesome on apple dumping equilivant to pillsbury good product good as name brand very good  used it to make cheese sticks just as good as pillsbury but better price just as good as the popular name brand they worked really well  but they don t come apart easily  taste good though very good and at a good price taste good buy this item regularly very good very quick and easy to prepare and yet so yummy good love to use it with brie excellent was good very difficult to separate into individual rolls  i recently made pigs in a blanket with the name brand and the great value brand  i couldn t tell the difference  i buy this product often and will continue to do so not as good as pilsbury  the cressants did not come off easily  they stuck together buy walmart brand products all the time  compares to brand name products the dough stuck together and only made   somewhat triangles  won t buy this again   sticking with pillsbury i purchase these all the time  never had a problem with them these are very tasty rolls  i was a little surprise as how good  considering the price these are so delicious  easy to bake these crescent rolls baked up flaky and buttery just as i hoped  served with dinner no leftovers my husband who is picking like them  so that says it all it s a bit stickier than the brand name item  i believe it s worth the price to go with the walmart brand this product is great  cooks just as well if not better than name brands  the only kind i purchase now wonderful crescent rolls  excellent taste  these are my new favorite rolls they are as good as the name brand product  taste the same  but cost a lot less the dough was not was to unroll or separate these crescent rolls are just the same as the expensive ones this is chemicals ok for replacement but still not as good on brand name product i used this for a crust and it was wonderful actually  the great value crescent rolls in my area s walmarts come in a white package with black and blue writing   plus a picture of a couple beautiful crescent rolls  nonetheless  i expect my experience with this brand and product is applicable  i bought   dozen of the various types   flaky butter  reduced fat  and standard   and all had the same problems to some degree  although i was using the rolls up to   weeks prior to the  jun  expiration date on the end cap of the packages  the dough in many packages was so dry  old poorly stored  that it would stick to the packaging  and it was impossible to unroll the dough  i had to pry off chunks   and then try to put the chunks together like a jigsaw puzzle into some frankenrolls  the other reviews say the same thing   going back as far as   and now i m extending that same complaint to mid  why has walmart continued to deal with the same supplier despite the same problem for at least   years my recommendation  spend the extra   cents  or whatever  on the real thing  pillsbury crescent rolls if i could give these crescent rolls less that a full star rating  i would  i would even give it a negative star  of course  whenever you buy any pre made dough in a pop can  you expect a pop  well  nothing happenedat first  i had to bang it on the counter to open  and when it did  it was more of a bang than a pop  and dough shot out all over the place  the dough that was salvageable  in no way resembled a crescent  i had to form it into triangles by myself  of course the dough was so sticky that it was nearly impossible  the taste of the finished rolls did however taste the same as name brand rolls  but the measly few cents saved to purchase the great value brand was not worth the extra work  and mess to purchase  from now on  i know to go with a more reputable brand i bought three of these for the first time to make a new breakfast casserole  one package was opened right after taking them out of the fridge and was the bottom of the casserole  the second package was opened after everything was prepped and put into the casserole  it was useless and had to be thrown away  it was a ball of sticky  gooey  unshapable dough  into the trash it went and my husband ran out to get another brand  we had one pack left that i just used this morning straight out of the fridge and the rolls were just as good as the name brand  my little ones even had seconds  i think that the fact that they were still really cold when i opened the package and put them on the cookie sheet really helped this is a good product and it works as expected  i am not sure why so many reviews are there criticizing it  you are buying a dough and you got to mold it as you need  not sure being flaky and all is a valid critic for this product  it holds shape as it should and bakes nicely it tastes good and nice  this worked just as planned and i was able to make rolls as planned  will recommend   thank you walmart  first off  i could not get the package open  then  when i opened it  there was no way to roll out the crescent shapes to form actual crescents  i had to break off bits of dough  roll them in my hands  and make drop biscuits  terrible these were terrible  it seems like they are just crammed into the packaging  there is no way to roll them out into triangles  it just comes out all smashed together and impossible to actually make crescent rolls out of them  i ended up having to roll it all out and make my own  too much work  next time i will be spending the extra   or so and going with pillsbury  heck  i d even pay   more to not deal with this garbage first  let s establish that the whole point of buying tube crescent rolls is that they come off in little triangles that can be rolled into crescents  hence crescent rolls  these are no where in the vicinity of crescent rolls  the dough stuck together would not unroll  where i needed triangles  i came out with sticky amorphous lumps of dough  it was   useless for the recipe i was making  i was severely disappointed and will never again purchase these the dough looked like it was crammed into the packaging  i could not use it without combining the dough to roll out and cut wedges myself  then they came out hard and very small  it must ve been at the end of the line and what was left over  this has happened more than once  will not purchase again  the savings is not worth it crescent rolls are something of an extra for us  we don t buy them real often because of the price but  great value crescents are so good and the price is reasonable that we don t have of splurge  i make rolls  use them for crusts  roll apple slices in them and slice them in long strips and sugar and cinnamon them  just twist them and you hace a great and fast snack  good eating these rolls were much smaller than pillsbury s and much harder to get out of the can  they ripped and shredded making them just about worthless  i will not purchase again the crescent rolls taste good   but the last couple of times i purchased them they were so smashed together i had to build crescent rolls out of the pieces that i could separate great item  just like the brand name stuff  sad thing is sometimes  you can get the brand name even cheaper than the wal mart brand i like them a little undercooked  so i pull them out a minute early  i like the taste much better than pillsbury crecents  easy and fast to make  they make a great snack or roll for dinner purchased these with a sell by date of january   opened them november     and they were shrunk to   can capacity and smelled bad  the container was undamaged prior to opening they were just as good as pillsbury and i saved money they fall apart when you get them out of package  they are different sizes too  they look like someone just threw them in the package when you open it unlike pillsbury crescent rolls i tried making a breakfast star with the perforated rolls and even though it was good it was a little more difficult  this time i bought the seamless roll and they are as delicious and easier it was cheap and tasted good it was impossible to unroll this tube of rolls they would not separate and i took them straight out of the fridge  i wound up rolling out the dough and slapping together my rolls very unhappy this is a terrific product  just a few drops in bourbon  straight up or mixed with agave nectar and lime make all the difference  would order again this is an amazing mix just add rum  i usually add a little pineapple juice and a cherry  mix it with crushed ice  enjoy i was so happy to have located mr mrs t mai tai mix at wallmart on line  it is nearly impossible to find it in nj  grocery or liquor stores  usually  i am not a fan of any bar drink mixes  particularly now sugary ones  but this one is a fabulous concoction  not too sweet  the flavors are well balanced between sweet sour  with a touch of bitter almonds  just excellent to drink as is or it is very simple to prepare an exotic cocktail by addiing baccardi rum garnish with maraschino cherry and a sliver of pineapple  on a skewer  i have been impressing our guests with it the entire summer   had to even give up one bottle to my neigbors  we are hooked  wallmart send the product promptly for a very reasonable sh charge  it arrived in good condition  product is shelf stable  i ll be ordering it again next season  or maybe earlier if we want to have a nice summer cocktail in the winter months i like to add a shot of light rum and a shot of spiced rum  it s a little sweeter than i would prefer but not bad at all for a premixed drink  it has been a hit at our pool parties i ve tried a number of different mai tai mixes and this is the best one by far  but it can be hard to find in stores  i m glad i found it online so that i no longer have to worry about finding someplace that carries it  for my perfect mai tai  i use a combination of trader vic s dark and spiced rums  this mai tai mix  and a splash of orange juice i could no longer fine my usual brand  even on the company website so i started looking for a new mai tai mixer  look it up  these are complicated to make from scratch  i kept seeing this brand so i decided to order it and was very pleasantly surprized  this mix is a little more pineapple than the last  but i like that great valve and product excellent for those who enjoy  experimenting with bacics and coming up with one to call your own great taste  easy to use and has no high fructose corn syrup apparently our area distributor stopped carrying this  we have tried other mixes but no other tastes this good  thank you walmart  our summer porch sitting is now complete these were delicious  i wish they came in a  count tube  they are becoming my first choice refrigerated biscuits i grew up loving shasta  but i can never find their best flavors  it comes with lemon lime  orange  grape  and fruit punch  my favorite is the punch and  in my opinion  the lemon lime is better than most lemon lime sodas  the grape and orange are just okay  it is nothing special  but it is a pretty good value  also nice to have a variety of sodas handy on hot summer days  especially when having guests over we purchased these for an event at school and they were a big hit  everyone loved the variety  it is nice to have something other than the big name  brown sodas  i remember shasta from when i was a kid and it is still good  great value for the money it s really good for kids and they will love  it has a variety which is great this is great for the kids variety and the price is right easy and fast tasty my kids love these  quick on the go breakfast for busy moms  no syrup required really nice my child could eat one every day taste great  quick to fix kids love them the pancakes are a quick fix and my boys and hubby love the taste these are great for an afternoon pick me up or a sweet treat after dinner that i don t have to feel back about they have a good chocolate taste good value for the item  my son loves it as a afternoon evening small meal quick and easy before school breakfast taste great portion my kids loved these kids love putting this in blender with fresh or frozen berries little sprite got a good slush or smoothy we don t like this brand as good as the dailey s brand  but it will do  we can t find the dailey s anywhere  so we settled for this  we don t use it for alcohol  we use it to make smoothies with great smooth product great taste and great price i use this item in my smoothies  i like it better than having to use juice  this with some yogurt and ice very good favorite mix if you enjoy making frozen drinks at home  great flavor i purchased for an island oasis machine  these work perfectly and taste great i love the taste bloodmary mix  the best product in the market  this review was collected as part of a promotion best bloody mary mix to use in making red eye s  product is great  but was not received in the best condition  packing was terrible   every bottle has several dents and even bends in the neck of the bottle  this review was collected as part of a promotion mr  mrs  at its best  if you haven t tried it  you haven t lived  walmart is the place to buy no matter what size your bank account is it s better than making a bloody mary from scratch   perfect every time excellent i recently have begun enjoying margaritas  i havent done a lot of searching for different mix and am pretty sure that this one is a good bet  i like my margaritas on the rocks and this mix seems to really do the trick as far as flavor  the reason i had even picked up a bottle to try is because the local golf course uses this to mix their margaritas and so i thought it would be a good start for me  i didnt have to search long to find it and i actually paid a decent price for it  the container is easy to pour out of and is sturdy  i use jose cuervo to mix my margaritas  although i think any tequila would work  i dont shake mine yet because i still need to buy a shaker but i do give them a good mix  the overall taste of the mix is sweet and tart  but not overly powerful on those to senses  i recently mowed my lawn and had a cocktail as i did so  and the mix was just the right flavor to enjoy a nice summer day  i will definitely be purchasing more of this mix in the near future and maybe adding different fruit flavors to it to punch it up a notch  but dont get me wrong the flavor out of the bottle is very good a little to sweet  does not taste like a margarita should this order arrived with three broken bottles and the bottles were   ounces rather than   ounces like shown in the website very good in whiskey sours and long island ice tea  cannot find in stores  this a great deal especially if get free shipping cheaper to buy on amazon com  i believe  and i tried to cancel this order  but it got here so fast my head was spinning the product is hard to find in my area  therefore it s great to get it online and shipped to me in two days with shopping pass membership helps internal operations great way to get extra fiber for us this is a good product at a reasonable price  we have used it for many years  ordering online was fast and easy and having it shipped right to our doorstep was great  it was on time and we experienced no problems  just the way we like it chewing a tablet daily is a very easy way to get fiber in your diet and control the amount of water that you are drinking and when you drink it easy to chew the taste is pretty good too i have been using fiber choice tabs for several years and feel they help keep bowel movements normal  they are a little pricey at  cents per tablet  but are much easier to take than mixing powders with water   so convenience is worth something i m the computer person  but the good wife says that these cured her constipation   years ago and won t be without them works pretty well the only downside to it is it makes you extremely gassy which can be embarrassing at times have used this for a few years  so happy i can get them delivered to my home now  i feel these tablets help keep me regular each day these are great i started taking for fiber digestion but noticed they where clearing up congestion in my chest caused by allergies and the immune system building part of these vitamins where clearing up my allergies love these vitamins for many reasons this source of chewable fiber is my favorite  it tastes fruity and it is convenient   those two reasons alone keep me from not making the effort  i simply can t stand the orange drink fiber option   it has a gross texture and makes me feel bloated after drinking it  these are kind of a treat  some reviewers don t care for these but dont strike me as chalky  or stick to teeth  or anything  this review was collected as part of a promotion this do a great job but i like the orange fiber choice you no longer carry better it is fine  but it lacked the weight control feature that i was hoping for  my fault  i guess  but it s fine otherwise this product works great  i have been taking it for years  wish it would come without any food colors tasty little treats  gives fiber and fills the sweet tooth  no gassy side effects great product these are good tasting  easy to chew and swallow  just take one and i am on my way  no mixing of powder or measuring  i like them a lot and they seem to help with me being regular if you need some fiber to help you these are the ones to definitely get it helps digestion took forever for walmart to ship this item love getting a great source of fiber in a delicious tablet great it was a good choice for me  it was delivered on time  i order azo i ordered two  but only got one because the person who delivered it dropped it over the gate and my dogs got a hold of it  there is a note on the outside of gate asking the person who delivers packages to put it on the ledge  and for some reason the person didn t read the note great way to increase fiber intake best price around  quality product  works as well as other brands  like the chewies  got one of these for a friend as well as two for myself excellent choice  have never seen locally this ginger cocktail is great for tea  a mixed beverage or straight over ice  it is very soothing for a sort throat i bough my first few bottles in vermont where this is made  onlne purchasing makes it easy to acquire instead of driving   hours great to use as a substitute for ginger in your cocktail mixes  you don t get the same freshness you get from grated ginger but it does the job in a pinch and don t let the price sway your selection  we have served these wines from super bowl gatherings to most recently our thanksgiving celebration  everyone enjoyed the wines and when we asked what they thought they cost  they couldn t believe the value  love the belle made for you wines delio only problem they cooked unevenly this is my favorite quickie great afternoon snack i love this stuff  i like coco lopez but it is in a can which makes it difficult to use just a couple of tablespoons  i add it to my fruit smoothies and gives them just that touch of sweetness and coconut flavoring to make them pop  right now i am using it with an orange chicken stir fry  my problem is that i have been looking for it for about a month and cannot find it at the walmart stores where i bought it originally  while this is a great product i really don t want to buy a case of it  however  if that is the only way i can get it i may have no other choice  please start stocking this in the stores i was searching for coconut syrup at my walmart one day  and i found this coco real in the mixed drinks section  while i don t drink alcoholic drinks  i do enjoy mocktails occasionally  so i figured if it wouldn t work for pancakes  then i could make pina colada mocktails out of it and some pineapple juice  i shook the bottle good to make sure everything was mixed well  then used it on my hot pancakes at home  it was sooooo good  i usually only use pure maple syrup on them  but wanted some coconut syrup  this really filled that need so well  it was so delicious that i do believe i wouldn t even need to use butter on my pancakes when i use coco real as my syrup  it s not been easy to find locally for some reason  not even at the walmart where i found it once  i bought the last two bottles walmart had that day  it would be very nice if walmart com would make it available by the bottle without having to purchase an entire case at one time  i used one of those two bottles up pretty fast  but since i can t find it anymore  i am saving my remaining bottle for when i will get a real bad craving for coconut syrup  torani also makes a good sugar free coconut syrup that i would like for walmart com to keep in stock regularly  as well as their sugar free watermelon syrup  in the hot summertime  torani sugar free watermelon syrup makes such refreshing drinks  and it goes well with mexican food  which i really enjoy  it s the next best thing to liquefying cubes of real watermelon in my blender and chilled it was a great buy great product  i wish walmart could keep these in stock  they have been out of stock for weeks  great value  each popsicle is huge  come on walmart  stock these already i m a very picky about buying prepackaged anything  but these are soooo good i drink this all day but it would be nice if a sugar free version was available can t find it anywhere in stores and the price is unbelievable check some of the prices people are asking  just move to maryland from virginia all va stores always had it on their shelves  i think it s as close to hand made as you can find  i will always have some on hand as long as i can find it it took me   orders to get the right product  the collins mix was to sweet for my taste  i tried diluting the mix to cut down on the sweetness but to no avail  i found a product called polar tom collins mix which was almost perfect and can be purchased on line for a much lower price very good product hard to find locally i prefer to purchase this in the store individually but will do whatever s necessary to get it  absolutely a magnificent mixer took   tries to get the right order  the product itself is very good the best collins mix you will ever find this is the best bloody mary mix i ve ever tried  the balance of spice is excellent and when i add the amount of vodka called for in the recipe it makes a very tasty   and not too strong   drink  my order arrived on the day i was told it would  was well packaged and in perfect condition  very good value for the price  i will order again good for pina coladas  no complains this mix is overly sweet and probably could lose the high fructose corn syrup  it also has a soapy taste often associated with coconut oil  i will be dumping it out i use carmex all the time  love it  keeps my lips moist i bought this for chapped lips and i got instant relief this is my favorite i love the jar lip therapy the best i use

moist and chap free the best product around  i just love this every winter i stack up on it its the first that ive tried thats not greasy carmex lip balm jar is best in class  there is no other lip therapy that gives the immediate results of carmex or even comes close i have been using carmex for years  tried a different brand for my lips and it s not the same  for the money  it s the best for me i love the jar more than the tube easier to dispense and doesn t get in the lid when it melts where it can t be removed easily ive been using this for years  its the only lip ointment that moisturizes my lips and keeps them from getting chapped  love it there is nothing better on the market than carmex  it is the only thing that works on severely chapped lips  it s the best  i have always used and recommended carmax as other don t come close  and its price is just a convenience as i would still love it we have used this product for   plus years in our family  i never leave home without my carmex  it is great to use year round i am careful of lip products i use  so when my lips get extra dry from the weather or from being ill  carmex is my go to lip care absoloutley amazing  it works so well for my awfully sore lips and gets to work in an instant i bought the original carmex two weeks ago  in that short time of daily use my lips feel so soft and no hint of dryness  i love the product i always go back to carmex original lip balm jar  the little jar fits perfectly in my purse and has never failed to soothe dry chapped lips i like carmex but this design is awkward if you put it in your pocket  have to keep my finger clean when using  not very functional i love carmex because not only does it take care of my lips  but during allergy season  when my nose is sore and chapped  it soothes it long time fan and this really works would tell anyone that is just what you nheed for great feeling lips also works great under lipstick i have used this product for years  love the way the jar is shaped and how the chap stick makes my lips feel  also love the smell of it i have little jars everywhere  on my bedside stand in my purse car  and my bag when i travel  it applies easily and works for me i love the jars of carmex  they work great and are long lasting  i don t think i ve ever finished a while jar  i end up losing them first i use carmen daily  i work in fresh seafood  going from freezers to refrigeration does damage on lips  apply my carmex  problem solved i have been using carmex for a long time and it is my favorite lip balm  i use it in all its forms  but i especially like the original jar i ve been using carmex since i ve been a little girl the only one i use i bought it week ago so happpy hope other people will enjoy it as much i did i buy carmex all the time  carmex is the best product i ve found to keep mine and my grandkids lips from being chapped in the winter time if your one of those people that are looking high and low for the perfect soft lips look no longer this makes the lips perfectly kissable the great thing about the jar is that i can keep it in my car in the summer  even if it melts  it stays in the jar and i can still use it love love love this stuff   can t do without it   only thing i have found that works so well for my chapped lips and to keep them soft  i have always loved the pot carmex  besides loving the

since high school  over   years  and absolutely love it  when i ran track and swam  my lips would get so dry and chapped   once i started using the product  i never had to deal with dry chapped lips

cold  i never leave home without it  i   carmex i have used carmex in the jar for probably   years  it is the best lip balm there is on the market  i have tried others over the years but always go back to my carmex  it just stays in my coat pocket all year long   especially in the winter carmex original lip balm is the benchmark for all of the others on the market  it is greaseless  odorless  and wonderful  it works so fast and well  i also use mine at night to keep the lips moist because of dry mouth  it works well for us i love the way carmex smells  it not only works better then anything else i have tried but it smells wonderful  the only thing that i found that works as well is anti biotic ointment but it does not have that great smell so give me carmex i use the original carmex in the little jar for so many things other than cold sores  such as all little scratches and cuts  it takes the itch or swelling away  also use in my mouth when i bite my tongue great reliever

carmex came to the rescue in the hospital zero humidity environment  great for cold weather protection in the cold wisconsin winters my husband is an avid hunter with sensitive skin  out in the elements at all hours his lips use to dry out and crack making my kisses hurtful  thanks to carmex his lips are protected and now softer and more kissable than ever  thanks carmex used this post facial surgery  helped my dry  cracked and painful lips  only thing that actually helped me feel healthy again  can t wait to use the other products i have been using carmex on my lips for as long as i can remember  this little yellow tub is full of moisture for my lips  it is convenient to carry easy to stick your finger in and grab a dab to apply  i would recommend this to anyone my son has used this for over   years  has never been unhappy or given a thought to try anything new  has never failed him  myself i like the tube but the products are great  please give it a try you won t have tolook anymore since i was a little girl  my mother being military she always carried the jar of carmex around in her uniform pocket  it s a brand i know  it s a brand i trust  from chapped lips to sore nose from a cold  i love that little yellow jar carmex has been keeping my lips clear of dry chapped lips and healing cold sor sores since i was a little boy  my mom would stand bt yhe door before we would go sledding and cover our lips w  it  its worked then and still workin today this product is fantastic  my lips are sensitive and when i use carmex original lip balm not only am i ready to face whatever the weather may throw at me but my lips feel great  i don t leave home without it and neither should anyone else i have been using carmex for approximately fourty years  carmex is the only lip balm that protects my lips from chapping  i personally know that if i did not have my carmex my lips would not be as smooth and vibrate as they are  thank you i tried carmex in the pot in   when my co worker introduced me to it  i was in my early  s and had dry chapped lips from the northeastern cold winter  started using carmex and within   days my lips were healed  never stopped using it if you wash your hands before putting this on  you don t have to worry about it a tube getting contaminated with a possible virus  you can even share it with friends  i also like that it isn t too glossy  the cooling sensation is nice too i bought carmex when i had a really bad case of chapped lips last winter after being out in the snow with my kids  a friend suggested that it would be the best remedy  it worked fast on my lips and it didn t leave an odd taste in my mouth i have been using this for awhile now  i suffer from cold sores and so many of the other products just dry your lips  i have found as long as i catch the cold sore soon enough carmex works just as well as the much more expensive brands i keep this product on hand year round it works wonders for dry cracked lips  once cooler weather hits  i make sure i have one carmex in my purse  once in my car and one at my desk  it is my go to product and makes my lips feel amazing when was a kid my mama would put carmex on lips then when she went to sleep i would roll the jar around the house carmex has been i part of life for   years and use it for my kids my   year old tries to eat it but now know how to use it i have been religiously used the original lip balm jar since i was seventeen and now i m forty one  i love it because of the fragrance and the silky feel  the taste is good too  i can t imagine replacing my carmex with anything else i have tried other enticing lip balms over the years but they never live up to carmex lip balm jar  i always come back to this for the same reasons it works  it moistens my lips for a much longer period of time than other competitors i have been wearing carmex since i was a child  i am   now and still apply it almost everyday  recently i was on mediation that really dried out my lips and carmex was the only thing that worked  love it  a must in my makeup bag purse we always purchase carmex lip balm in the jar  it is usually hard to find so when we do find it we empty the shelf to have it on hand  winters can be harsh in pennsylvania so we do not want to run out it keeps you lips soft year round my son cody always got chapped around the outside of his mouth  in the winter time and his cheeks we would put carmex on it ad within a day it would heal it up and it would be gone we love this stuff it seems to work on almost everything i have been using carmax for at least   years or more  i use nothing else for my lips but carmax  due to cold sores since i was   no other products work  no lipsticks  it is a everyday thing for me no exaggerating that is the truth i keep this on my nightstand and use it as part of my night time moisturizing  i love the way my lips feel in the morning  i forgot it on vacation once and could tell a huge difference  i love how lightweight but effective it is everyone in our house uses carmex for chapped lips but that s not the only use  my husband has found it to be most helpful for the cracked skin around his fingernails  it provides relief from pain and helps to heal these sore spots  too this was the first carmex product i tried  i remember putting it every night before going to bed and waking in the morning with my lips feeling rejuvenated and fresh  i also used it during the day to protect my lips from the sun i use this on my lips all year long for soft kissable lips  i also use it on my upper lip and outside my nose when i have a cold  i put it on at night and when i wake up in the morning you would never know my skin was sore or chapped i purchase about   carmex lip balms per month i enjoy the silky smooth texture it gives my lips  i love the feel and so does my husband  i make sure i always have a jar in my purse  car  work  every where  i really enjoy your product i ve tried lip balm in sticks and tubes  but the carmex jar is still the best container  maybe it s just habit but the unscrew and finger dip applies the protection and revitalization of carmex more satisfactorily than any other method i have used the original carmex lip balm jar for as long as i can remember  it s my go to for lip care  living at high altitude means dry air and chapped lips  so i keep carmex handy at all times  purse  bathroom  computer table  etc i have been buying carmex in the jar for over   years  i have found many other uses for carmex  for more than just soft  great  healthy lips  i love my carmex  and do not feel dressed without it  try it  you will love it  thank you carmex for keeping my lips looking and feeling the best i love carmex lipbalm  i have been using it since i was a small child  i love the smell of it  i use it all the time living in michigan you tend to have to endure some frigid winters  with the cold temperatures you also deal with cold winds that dry your skin and chap your lips  using carmex  you not only heal your chapped lips  you also create a great barrier that helps prevent them from capping again i ve used the lip balm jar for quite a few years now  needless to say that i have no complaints about it  live in tx where it is hot as heck and my lips don t dry out  just make sure you put it on before going outside  never put it on as your walking  you ll get sunburned lips  no joke i have been using the regular jar for over   years now  carmex is great at stopping a fever blister before it even gets going  i like the little magic in the jar  it is easy to spot in cabinet and easy to feel for in bottom of my purse  trust carmex it s the best and has been for years i have very dry and chapped lips  by the way i have a very bad habit  that i would like to rubber my lips when i feel there s dead skins on them  so my lips are often chapped and blooding  since i use this carmex lip balsam  i can keep my lips always im guten zustand  really love it i got carmex   weeks ago and when i got it my lips were cracked after just   days my lips were smooth and heeld i have been using this product since i was a teenager  long summer days filled with too much sun caused havoc on my lips  but carmex saved them  i still use it every night besides when i m in the sun  i have passed this secret down to my teenage daughters  who refuse to use anything else i enjoyed using carmex and it was good buuuuuut mih lips is still chapped dried and it feels rrrrrough on both sides so all i wanted is just to heeeeeeeal it up to get back to smoothness i have to have this little tub of moisture  the relief is unbelievable when my lips are chapped  also  i find it soothing when i ve been sitting out at one of my kids games all day in the wind and sun  honestly have one of these in my car  purse and the kids have them in their backpacks not only does carmex cure my chapped lips in no time  it also cures my sore and burned nose during cold and flu time  if you haven t tried it on your tissue burned nose  i urge to to try it  it works so good  plus  the minty eucalyptus type smell opens your nostrils    birds  one stone my favorite lip product for years  i always keep multiples around the house and in my car when my son was small  he got his own jar of carmex and he thought he was so big  he would put it on his lips  mosquito bites  any scratch  we bought carmex for every car and every jacket pocket  worked wonders even on the bug bites  carmex is an old family friend  trusted and loved i love carmex  however it is really difficult to find here in brazil it s been a year since i started using this product and i m glad to say it changed my lips for the better  i ve recommended this product to many friends who have dry  chapped lips like myself and they share the same feelings  definitely will be repurchasing this for a very long time carmex lip balm jar is my absolute go to when my lips are really dry  chapped or cracked  no other will do for me  it s smooth  not greasy  and leaves my lips feeling soft and hydrated  there s just something about the little jar packed full of relief that is a must in my household  in the jar is best  it goes on so creamy smooth soft has a hint of vanilla scent a sweet taste w  just the right amount of menthol  carmex is the best lip balm  period  i can t stop

yes  it works  i lip my lips a lot and it stays on my mother used this on me when i was little and i continue to use it today  i thought i was strange because all my friends always had chapstick but not me  i had my carmex and the most awesome thing in the world is that both me and my boyfriend use it  i guess we are just that awesome occasionally in the winter i get chapped lips  not something that happens often  but when it does i absolutely must have my carmex in the jar  it is the only thing that heals my lips fast  i ve tried other products  but carmex is the one i depend on i have been buying this product for many years and wouldn t think of buying another brand  it has stood the test of time in protecting and healing my dry chapped lips  keep up the good work  i recommend this product to anyone  cheers  for carmex loyal customer  fan unofficial pr person for this product  aka best lip balm ever  always perfectly moisturizing  healing and effective long after initial use  perfect as base  lip balm or solution to chapped lips  cold sores and more  stock up works really well during the day for long lasting moisture and overnight to loosen up that gross dead skin on your lips   smells great i go through a bunch of them  my younger brother often tries to pull one over on me and snag a couple jars the jar container is my other favorite because i can leave it in my car without worrying that it will melt and leak like the ones in the tubes sometimes do  i love that i can have the product at hand no matter where i am or where i m going i have used carmex since i was a little girl  i frequently get cold sores and this is the only thing that helps clear them up in a timely manner  i have tried the more expensive treatments and none worked on me  i don t leave leave home without it i have used this product for years  literally over   years  i work out in the weather and it heals and protects in all types of weather  have one in my vehicle and house i have a problem with cold sores   usually keep abreva on hand  but i have found that carmex really helps with the discomfort of having a cold sore  so in addition to using it as a moisturizer  i now use it every time i have a cold sore outbreak carmex is a must have in my family especially in the winter time  our grandmother taught us to buy the carmex lip balm jar to keep favorite earrings in when it was empty  i love how smooth it makes my lips feel and how long it protects my lips i bought this   days ago as my lips had become sore in the cold weather  unfortunately i had a burning sensation on my lips  i washed it off and tried it again the next day with the same sensation this stuff may not smell the best but it s perfection in a jar  it s smooth and thick but not greasy and will protect your lips especially in the winter  i use it to help cold sores heal but i also use it to help protect from them  affordable too i have been using carmex since the mid  s when it was still in the little glass pots  i keep the empties and refill them  there s something about the weight and feel   i have used a lot of different lip balms and carmex is the best by far i had dry lips and my lips were pealing and my husband knew i needed this because i had an engagement to go to and i wouldn t go looking like this so he bought it for me and said use it and it worked in a few hours and my lips looked a lot better this product seemed to help my cold sore heal faster  i ve never used it previously and this time my cold sore only lasted a few days  and didn t seem to get as bad as it usually does  amazing for the price  skip expensive abreva and use this i have been using carmex original for many years  i have tried other lip balms  but nothing works as good as carmex  i have a bad habit of chewing my lips and i apply carmex every night and by morning they have healed  i won t use anything else i have never run out of this caramel for as long as i can remember  i keep at least   on hand at all times  there is always   sitting next to me  never stop making the container as i feel it works quicker and more effectively that the stick i bought this on a whim around   days ago  and i m so glad i did  the results were instant and my dry  chapped lips were gone straight away  and it lasts for hours  definitely purchasing again i have used this since i was little its my favorite lipbalm too i can buy lipbalms but i will still perfer this one i use it every night before i go to bed i ve been using this product for   something year s it s always been there for me  it taste great and it sooths  and heals sore chapped lips  thank you for making such a great product i have been using for over   years and love  keeps lips soft and full  rarely do i even use lipstick for color  i prefer original jar texture to other containers  hope to use the rest of my days for lovely lips i started using carmex as a cna  it is the only brand i can count on to heal my supper sensitive and dry skin  i wish you sold a larger container i bought it six months ago  i never have any lip balm as good as carmex  it is very cheap and i dont have to use a lot carmex on my lips  but it helps on my lips i ve been using carmex in the jar for a long time  it s my favorite product to use on my lips  works nice on cracked lips  especially on the side of my mouth  one or two applications and the red dry cracks are gone i have been using carmex for chapped lips since my lips were always chapped when i was a kid  my dad gave it to me and said this works great and dad s know everything  that was   years ago and i still use it today i remember being a kid and my grandma used to use this on the entire family during cold  winter months keeping our lips healthy and soft  never missing carmex in my purse i now continue the legacy with my children i have been using carmex for   years  my old containers list alum as an active ingredient  your new original formula does not list alum  what gives ive been using carmex lip balm for many many years oh yeah ive been talked into trying others but always came back to carmex theres nothing better and it works fast carmex lip balm is my forever go to lip balm i love the original jar carmex lip balm  i can t live without it during the dry and brutal winter every year  it save my lips from look like flicking fish scales to smooth as baby bottom lips  i absolutely love it the long time favorite container now has a severely indented bottom end this allowing for less product  very disappointed by this new implementation  smaller for the same great higher price i buy the carmex in the tub becuase it is how my mother always had it we wood open it up and smell that wonderful carmex scent  glides on smooth but its scent is what i love the best no other brand smells like it i have used carmex for years  i have tried other products but nothing compares to carmex in keeping my lips protected from the heat of summer or the cold of winter  thank you for making such an amazing product the original carmex is my go to product  i use this every morning after washing my face and this product makes my lips feel like silk the whole day  the carmex jar can last me a couple months too so that s a plus this is the only lip product i use  i wouldn t get through the winter without it  sometimes when i have a cold and my nose is sore i will even put a little bit on my nose before i go to bed and it really helps i always prefer this one because it s really very smooth to lips til the very last in the jar  unlike the other lip balm that s not do their job after couple use  so i always stick with this one  the original i buy these often and try to keep   in each purse  love the reliability of the product  it s great all year long  but especially during the fall and winter  great for use before applying lipstick too i ve used this for past   years  bought it one winter and realized not only did it heal my chapped lips but i use it nightly and feel it s keeps my lips from getting dry or cracked overnight  love the smell too this little jar s contents are the item to go to when those stress or seasonal painful eruptions appear on my poor husband s lips  saves the day everytime and it applied soon enough shortens the time of distress i carry one of these in my purse all the time  i love that it is in a small jar so i can find it with no problem  it works great and my lips and they never get chapped when i use regularly  i love the product i always have a jar of this in my purse on my desk  i ve used this product since i was a kid  this is the only thing that i don t get sick of  that doesn t explode all over my purse on hot days  it keeps me from chapping during the winter  which is more than i can say for any other lip product i bought carmex several years ago when i had a big bad break out of cold sores that spread all over my lips  with in   to   weeks of using carmex my lips and the cold sores were pretty much gone and the cold sores have pretty much have never come back  i have also gotten my brother to use carmex to i absolutely love carmex and am totally addicted to it  i love it so much and use it so much  that i actually kept all of my jars for a whole year to see how many i use  it ended up being   jars in a year  i always have   in my pocket    in my car    in my purse l  and   by my bed at all times i have used carmex branded products for years  my favorite is the jar  i apply this at night before bed as well as during the day  it stays on better than most other brands and my lips stay smooth and soft  i recommend all of the carmex products  they are inexpensive and work wonders for your lips i love it because my lips get chapped real fast and i grabbe it and that is my ride buddy and do melt fast but it is good using i had this laying around in my medicine basket  and one day i picked it up as a last resort to other lip repairs and i have to say i should of gone with this atype the start i know alot of people don t like potted lip balms but i am just the opposite  carmex not only keeps my lips soft and healthy looking but i really love that carmex tingle and the scent is the kind of different i appreciate  i ve been using this since highschool and i m   so its a life long love i have been using this product since i was a child  my mom swore by it and now as a mom of   i swear by it  it is the only product that i can put on my kids or my lips before going to bed and wake up with completely healed lips during winter and cold and flu season  best lip product out there this is the only chapstick i use  it works amazing and a little bit goes a long way  fixes chapped lips and doesn t have a nasty taste or smell  since they are small and compact i keep one in my car  my purse  the medicine cabinet  and next to my bed  this is definitely one of my must have items i have used carmex lip balm as far back as i can remember  it has been around for ages because it works  it s a great value  it s never sticky or greasy  does not taste or smell weird  like some other ones  is the best value  buy multiples to have them at home  work  in your purse etc i have used carmex for a very long time  i have a jar at work  at home  in my purse  when i feel a cold sore coming on  i immediately put some on my lips in my opinion  it definitely helps it heal much quicker  my kids know if their lips start to get chappy  they need to get their carmex on carmex in the original jar is my go to for everything from wind chapped lips to winter cracking and anytime my lips just feel a little dry  it works the best every time and although i ve tried just about everything else on the planet  nothing beats carmex  carmex beats everything for anything the current jar i am using  i got from my mother s house after she passed  my siblings were going to throw it away  i told them to take their hands off of it because she ad just purchased it in december  and this was march  the best lip balm my mother  bless her heart  ever introduced me to you ive been using this product a couple of days now ans has done absaloute wonders for me  ive always suffered very dry lips no matter what abd have always used vasaline that never worked  my lips are so soft and no cracks anymore this little tin of carmex is amazing  seems to last forever and is small enough to take anywhere and everywhere without getting damaged  this product seems to be a miracle worker i go from dry chapped lips to smoothhh moisturised lips in the space of minutes  can not get enough of carmex i ve been using carmex since my mom gave me a jar in high school and i ve never gone back  nothing else works even remotely as well i won t buy any lip balm if it s not carmex  thank you for making something so perfect  please never change o  m  g   carmen is thee best   i have the jars tubes stick balm in every possible place   nightstand glove box medicine cabinet duffle bag purse gym bag locker infamous junk drawer jacket pocket i can t live without it     thank you for the worlds greatest product  i ve been using carmex now i don t use anything else it s much better than blistex a few weeks ago i was looking for the lip balm that i usually buy but the store didn t have any  i saw carmex s lip balm jar and thought i d give it a try  so glad i decided to  i really love it and the way it makes my lips feel  now i know what one to buy the next time i need more carmex i was introduced to this when i entered the army  in the px there was tons of this stuff  all of us recruits got a jar and boy were we glad  it helped us get thru a horrible oklahoma winter    years later i never forgot how it saved me and still use it to this day  i m sure those guys do too out of all the lip protectors this is the only one that works and i have tried a lot of different chap sticks trying to save money or wanting to get a good flavor or just the right color doesn t matter carmex is the only one that works thank you for making it my sister has used carmex in a jar for years  she would even put it on her eyelids at night  lol not quite sure why  but never had sagging skin there  i loved the fragrance started using it myself way back when  i will never use anything else  it really conditions my lips i ve used carmex for years and am very happy with the product  i m just curious  did the formula change it seems to smell different  maybe my sniffer has changed  please keep up the good product for as long as i can remember i ve been using carmex on my lips  this one in the jar is my favorite  the smallest bit goes the longest way and you ll probably lose it before you run out  i love applying it before lipstick so my lips stay nice and moisturizer all day long been using this stuff as far back as i remember  don t go anywhere with it  tried several other products but not as good  started with the jar  then the tub  and now the stick  highly recommended  don t even bother trying anything else  when you have the best  why bother a month ago my lips along with the rest of me got very sunburned and i tried the blistex i had and it wasn t helping at all  i was in the gas station and picked some carmex up and wow instant long lasting relief  thought to myself  wish i could spread this all over my body i really like carmex in general  i started with using the jar when i had chapped lips and i was sold the first time  by the end of the day i could feel my lips healing up  now i have long nails so i have graduated to the lipstick looking carmex and i love that one as well i have been using this for years literally  i am   and have used this since the  s i love carmex  love the small container that it comes in  it really works for me a lot  especially in winter time  my face gets really dried out   i use a little bit on the dry parts of my face   it works great  thanks for such a great product  i buy nothing but carmex it works so great on my cold sores  the moment i saw one coming up and i instantly put it on and the irritation stops  then i swear it sped up the blistering and leaking time as well and now it s scanning over and healing right now  love it i buy this all the time and i have at least   open at one time in my purse  by my computer desk  right on my night stand and of course one riding my car  i have dry lips all the time and carmex is my best friend it keeps my lips soft and moist and kissable for my husband coming into spring my lips were so dry that i couldn t even open them right up  lipstick looked bad on me and was embarrassing  i tried nivea  manuka honey lip balm and more  a week ago i heard the ad on the radio about carmex  so i stopped to buy it  best decision ever the others seem only to provide a barrier over the lips whereas carmex actually moisturizes and heals them  i love this stuff  i ve used it exclusively for as long as i can remember  let everyone else try what they will   i ll have only carmex i have used carmex lip balm jar ever since i was a little kid and though people make fun of me because i m old school i don t care i love it  it gets the job done and keeps my lips smooth and protected  i appreciate it and so does my wife    thanks carmex i have used carmex for years  it is the only lip moisturizer therapy that works for my lips  i have tried many others including all the name brand type but carmex is the only one that works every time  i use it winter and summer i bought this one day hoping it would help  that was   years ago and i have used it every night since  we keep   on my husbands night table and on mine  my lips are slathered when i go to bed and when i wake up  they are baby soft  love my full pout with this product i v been using carmex for as long as i can remember i m   now i tried others but always go back i like the jar because you can use what you need and it s like an old friend when lips are dry the old yellow and white jar is just the ticket   btw i miss the glass jar  you can always rely on a jar of carmex to relieve your chapped lips all year round  i especially use it throughout the winter and keep one in my pocket  and the nightstand  and the kitchen  and the desk  i ve even used it on my nose when i have a cold to protect it been using lip balm for many years  tried just about every brand  carmex has been the best for my lips  i stopped trying brands after carmex  and when the can was introduced  wow  takes away any disadvantage of tubes rollers always keeping my lip protection protected last year i was having a lot of trouble with very dry chapped lips  tried chapped stick  which normally helps  but this time it was not  so i purchased carmex in the jar and started using it and immediately started to see relief  i keep it handy in my bathroom i have been an avid carmex original lip balm jar user for years now  i don t think i could ever use anything else  i love the way it moisturizes my lips without feeling waxy or gunky  the price point is completely reasonable as well i have bought many products for chapped lips  i bought carmex one day years ago and loved it  carmex is the best  i don t buy anything else now  it is also good for coldsores  i love the cool feeling on my lips  carmex rocks back when i was little and complained about my super dry and chapped lips i remember my dad handing me a little jar of lip stuff now i have all forms of carmex but this one holds memories as i apply it to fix my aweful lips worse case of chapped lips ever  desperate we stopped at a drug store and sked for the best and fastest cure  was advised to use carmex  it started working right away and in a few days the lip licking and soreness had disappeared my mother used this product  and now i use it and so does my grown daughter  it has worked well to heal cracked dry lips and i ve tried lots of products over the years but always come back to carmex  now  i won t use anything else carmex is my go to product most of the time when my lips are dry  i love the original jar just because thats what i grew up with i think  but i really love all carmex products  i love the smell  feel and how it helps my chapped lips living in the desert  it is a struggle to keep my lips from drying out and cracking  when daily summer temps are over   degrees daily  protecting my lips is important  the only thing that works is carmex  i prefer the original jar i used to use eos and i found out that i was allergic to it so i stuck with carmex  carmex is the best lip balm in the world our family loves carmex  you will find carmex in every room of our house  our cars  we are boyscout leaders and we all have carmex in our backpacks  our kids all get carmex in there stockings for christmas  can t live without it carmex jarred lip balm reminds me of being a little girl and going to the water park with my family  my mom would put it on my lips to prevent them from being sunburned  she always carried it in her purse and now  so do i   i buy this every year  its a must have for the winter months  not only is it great for your lips but its also great for the rough egdes of your nose when its chapped  always has been the greatest product  and it also smells good i have been using camex in the jar for the last   yrs  i used it once in the morning also again before i go to sleep  i enjoy the way it feels and protects my lips  my wife says i crazy for as many times i apply the wax to my lips i have been a fan of carmex for years  i wish i could remember when i first used carmex for my cold sore  but i m sure it was   years ago and i never leave home without one in my purse  love  love  love this product thanks this is the only lip balm i purchase  my lips get dry easily and i get a cold sore a couple times a year  once i feel a cold sore coming on  i apply this and can feel it start to work immediately  i would recommend this to anyone i have been using carmex since i was a little girl because of my mom  carmex is her absolute favorite lip balm and i don t blame her  she has also been using carmex forever  i have never had a lip balm work as well as carmex carmex is the only thing that saves my precious lips in the blustery windy cold of western ny   remember buffalo last year  i have used this since i was a kid and i cant imagine ever changing because this works the best i have been buying these little pots for years not only to heal my lips but to protect them this product keeps my lips soft and full and free from painful cracks during the winter as a pharmacist i also recommend this product this is the product i remember using the very most it seems as a child it was just always around us all the time  for cracked winter skin  then when the heat came out and cracked even more just great to have handy always the minute my lips can t take anymore of the harsh conditions of the florida sun i reach for the cooling and soothing relief of my old stand b  carmex lip balm in the jar  i apply it at night and by morning my lips are healed  this is a go to product you will rely on again and again i have used this product for over   years  it is part of my makeup routine before applying lipstick in the morning  and used throughout the day  i don t know what i would do without carmex during the winter season living in the midwest  it keeps my lips moisturized and looking great i always keep carmex on hand  it is always nice to have during harsh summer sun or cold ia winters  gives your lips healing security  toss it in your purse or keep it in your pocket always there to heal  nothing compares for those dreaded cold sores that peak during the flu season there are harsh cold winters and dry summers in chicago which can really affect my lips  moisture and protection is what i wanted and so i bought this product for those reasons  not only did it deliver but it also healed my chapped lips  only negative is that i have to use my finger nearly   been using this for years on lips and cuticles  i wish the packaging didn t change  the inverted bottom isn t right  wish there was a vegan version was available  how is the lanolin derived for this product my favorite before all the changes i have been using carmex for decades and will not use anything else  we lived in maryland in the late   s and i could not find it there  when i came home to kansas i bought enough to last and some for other people from kansas that were there too  i highly recommend it to anyone ive been using this for   years and so far its been a product i use every single day  its my go to product  honestly its so amazing  after scrubbing ur lips put this on and ur lips feel amazing and smooth  and results are great in the morning when applying this before sleeping i have been using this product for about   years  i started because i was getting very chapped lips and nothing was helping  i use it in the morning and at night everyday  have not had chapped lips  or cold sores in   years  i recommend to anyone who has problems with their lips i have been buying the carmex jar as long as i can remember  the reason i have bought it for so many years is i was in the military and would throw it in my bag work bag  i never had the jar crushed or come open even when the bag was tossed around and all my gear would hit it we us both use the original jar and tube  my son use it all the time  i buy it in bulk  mu son use it a lot  he is outside with sports  so we have to keep a lot of it  we don t see much of the other flavors  just strawberry or cherry  we stick to the originals jars and tubes i buy this type of carmex all the time  it is my favorite one out of all the choices  i am always using it when the corners of my mouth crack  it is the only product that i have used that heals them  i absolutely recommend this product for anyone who has any type of lip issue i have used carmex for over   years  i don t go anywhere without a tub or stick  it keeps my lips soft and moist  and protected in the cold winter months  especially while skiing and snowshoeing  the only thing i d ever change is i d bring back the mint flavor  it was the best in middle school when my lips started to burn like crazy  had to go the doctor  they said i had wind burn n told me to go get some carmex  really but it did the trick    yrs old n it help me from get rid of my wind burns on my lips each time i get them  thank u i have used carmex for as long as i can remember  the fragrance is what drew me in  i thought well  at least my lips will smell good but i was pleasantly surprised at how moist and smooth it kept my lips  i have a jar of carmex at my desk  one in my purse and i never run out having a daughter with excema is hard so when ever she suffers from sever dry lips and cold soars i always can count on carmex to deliver  works amazing and helps heal dry chaps lips  love how its helps the itchy feeling and protects her lips from sun exposure and cracking i have been a big fan of the carmex jar since i was a little girl in elementary school  this would be the only product i would let my parents buy me  living in northern minnesota a person really needed this  i love the little yellow jar and the smell too  best product ever i love this product  it s the original and the one that i first used b c my dad always used it and swore by it  i love how quickly it works and that is works so great  really keeping my lips from getting chapped and cracked and once they are  it works quickly to heal them i have been buying this version of car next lip care since i was   i am now   years old  it is a regularly used part of my beauty regime  keeps your lips soft smooth for hours  using this product regularly also keeps those dry  irritated winter lips away  it s amazing i bought this size container for my dad very often  he always had sore corners of his mouth  and he loved the round container  he wanted to always be ready for kisses  from me and his nurses  and it always healed the corners of his mouth w o a bad taste  he used it daily i love this stuff i was addicted to bliss stick but for the last   years i ran across this at the store it was so smooth and not greasy on my lips and i have bought it faithfully every year i don t really care for the cherry but i will use it even my grandkids call it by name they have to have their own personal one also we love it the big thing in high school was to always have car ex in the jar  i graduated in   and have been using ever since  i may not be able to find my keys  money  etc  in my purse  but i can always find my carmex  leaves my lips feeling soft and smooth and cures dry chapped lips in no time  i can t live without it  love this product i bought this   days a ago and i m a first time user of this brand and not sure if i use again as my lips are on fire every time i apply is this a normal reaction or am i just using the wrongs thing because thousands of people across the world rave about how amazing it is feedback would be great to hear i had tried a new lip butter  but went back to carmex original lip balm jar because it lasts longer  and is less expensive  i used to apply lip balm sticks during the day  and carmex jar at night  but the lip balm sticks don t last  so now i use the jar all day  too  i even bought a package of   jars because it saves me money i grew up with this in my house  my mom always had some that she used all the time in the winter also whenever she got a cold sore  i never had any colds sores  so i do not know if it really helps with that  but i do know that it is great for those dry cracked windburned lips that those of us living up north get every winter this is my go to lipbalm  i apply in the morning maybe   am  and i let it sink in and all day i have the feeling of comfort  no dry lips  no reaplying  unless it aroung the time i go to sleep  perfect solution for dry lips  it gives my lips a healthy look  it s also great to apply before lipstick  im so happy with this product nostalgic  classic jar  heals raw feeling cold sores or chap with ease  it s a must for me in florida helps fade dark spots of dark skin  economical price  easy to find in stores  i first started using it years ago after a pharmacy employee recommended it as an over the counter cure for my inquiry on healing the side of my lip i ve been using carmex for more than   years now and i have literally nothing bad to say about it  i can t leave the house without it and it really soothes my dry lips  i even use it now as a primer before i put on any lipstick just so that my lipstick sets moist and nice  this item is highly recommended and very addicting   d my sister has a jar of this and i have to say i just love the tingleas you can literally feel the product rejuventating your lips  it s not as greasy and some other products which is great as it does not feel like you have a layer or oil on your lips haha  carmex also smells amazing and is worth every penny    from me i have using this farmed in the lip balm jar for as long as i can remember  not o lyrics does it help the moisture of my lips but that little jar has been a part of just about every life event  it attended my wedding  the birth of my children and numerous other events  to me it is more than a way of life it is part of my life i come from a long line of carmex users absolutely could not live without it  i keep at least   bottles  if not more  in my home at all times  one in my purse  one in my bathroom  one in my living room so that no matter where i am there s carmex nearby  that tells you how much i use it love it    i highly recommend it i have loved carmex in a jar since i was a little kid  i am biased as i m from wisconsin and carmex is a wisconsin company  but that just means they understand how chapped lips and skin can get  this is the only thing i have ever used that actually works and it works overnight most times i have dry skin on my lips  i love it for   years i gave been sort of addicted to always have carmex with me wherever i go  i can t sleep unless i have carmex on my lips  i love carmex and i will always use it and nothing else because carmex is the best for my lips i have used original carmex in the jar for many years  it never lets me down  it gives me the relief i need and the healing that i want  it s tried and true for me and i ll continue to use it for years to come  i ve tried the other carmex varieties and tje tubes but the original jar is my favorite  a bit of nostalgia for me i bought this originally to soothe my painful cold sores  it was one of the only products that actually worked and didn t make them dry out  i continued using this product lonnnngggg after cold sores were a problem in my life  it is so soothing and moisturizing  i m definitely a carmex snob  no other product works this good my daughter introduced me to carmex lip balm  i use it every day  and find the initial tingle when applied so refreshing  but i find it difficult to find stockists for it  can you tell me of all places that stock it in coventry one day after years of battling chapped lips someone suggested i try carmen so i did low and behold it worked better then any other chap items i had used whether it was chapstick or vaseline or any lip balms etc i still put a small coat on my lips even if they are not chapped just because it prevents chapping and feels good ihave used this product since i came back to chicago in   as a home care rn i have been exposed to the elements over and over in a day carmex has saved my lips  i stocked up buying boxes as my son entered kindergarten as he always would leave them somewhere as young boys do he s   and still using the products thanks i use nothing but carmex for chapped lips  this is my all time favorite package because it is rugged and durable and can go anywhere   from being tucked into a jeans pocket to the bottom of a backpack  easiest method to apply just the right amount too my family and i have been using carmex for decades  it is the best item on the market for keeping your lips and mouth healthy  i even send my daughter in wisconsin   carmex products since the winters are long  a third generation is now using the product better than any other treatment for cold sores  does not dry it out and heals faster  one more area it is great on is sore fingernails  yep  that s right  ever cut too short that it hurts  try putting some carmex from the jar on it  relieve is on the way ever since i started skiing in colorado and found out about carmex it is all i will ever use  great lip protection in all weather conditions  i have been a loyal user for over   years  other products come and go but none of them ever match up to carmex i had an appointment with a new dentist and she put carmex on my lips to keep them moist well ever since that day i always buy carmex i love this product it keeps my lips soft shiny moist and stays on long too  i would definetely recommend this product  carmex  has helped my dry  thyroid cancer skin  i just love this  my lips  and such get so dry  it is a perfect product  i love the jar  cause it fits in the purse  glove compartment  pocket  etc  lasts long also  only a little dab will do it great price on this very good product i m a huge fan of carmex and the little classic jar  first off carmex feels great on the lips and the smell is very appealing  the little jar is just so old school i m glad it s still available  i highly recommend carmex over all for your chap lip needs my mother was actually buried   with a jar of carmex in one hand and a kleenex in another  she was never seen without either  i would purchase the carmex jar by the box for her  she would have a jar always within a few feet  if not closer  to her i am  by far  the first to go the natural route for anything  however  carmex is the best lip balm that i have ever found  there just isn t anything quite like it  healing  penetrating  numbing  if i could be addicted to a lip balm  this would be it i have been using carmex forever  when you see the little jar you know that relief is just seconds away  this original product reminds me of going to the drugstore and seeing the little jar right by the cash register  great memories of a great product i use this product religiously  if i forget it at home when i go to work  i get another jar on my way to work  i can t go without it  my lips are always dry and chapped  as i am a lip chewer  and carmex always helps my lips heal  and stop hurting i dont know when carmex was invented  but i was   years old when i started using it my lips were split and blistered from the cold wisconsin winter  the pharmacist in our local drug store recommended it  i still use it today and i am   years old i ve been using this for years it is awesome  works for dry  chapped lips  even works on break outs  yes  it works on pimples  try it  it works  i always keep some in my bedroom  one in my purse one in the bathroom  love it  thank you  carmex carmex original lip balm jar has been a staple in my life my entire life  its a must in the car  purse  backpack  diaper bag and i wouldn t be exaggerating if i told you it s in every room of my house  it just simply works  no muss  no fuss  no waste if i don t have   carmex in my bag  i don t leave home    pot    stick    tube  i think am addicted   truth is am prone to cold sores and need to use it often to safeguard my lips  wish you had special deals for clients who can t live without it i ve been using this carmex product for many years  and it still works the same as it always did  carmex does a great job keeping my lips moisturized  especially in colder weather  even when i don t have dry lips  i consistently moisture with carmex i bought this and it is really good  but is smells really bad i have been buying carmex since i was a teenager  through the years  many new products have came out  i have tried them all  in the end  i always found myself back to using carmex  the only lip product that has worked for me  time and time again love that smell  works great too  and congrats on the sponsorship of the lambeau college football game in sept  what a great honor  i hope to make it  go wi and go bucky i love carmex original lip balm in a jar  i use it all the time  it works not only on your lips  but also for problem skin areas like ears  hairline  chin  elbows  etc  i love the consistency and the flavor  it lasts a long time and helps to heal any kind of skin  just wish it came in a larger size than   oz  i would love a   or   oz size  i put this stuff on every night before i go to bed  it keeps my lips happy  healthy  and soft  plus  i like the tingle  i had a boyfriend who hated that i do that because he didn t like anything  squidgy  on my lips in the event he might want to kiss me  boyfriend gone  carmex still on my lips every night  enough said  choose your battles i ve used carmex ever since i moved to this arid climate and spent a weekend at a friend s house that lived off the beaten path  by sunday my lips were parched and i was miserable  we went to a local store and i lucked upon a shiny tub of golden lip relief  i keep   of them in the house  a couple in my truck  and a couple more on my desk i buy this every time i need something for my lips  its the best i even buy some for back up  to have some put back just in case  i don t use anything else  i definitely recommend it to my friends and every one  its good for everything if i have dry cracked lips or chapped lips  anything its my go to saver  i love it  nothing else compares i ve been using this product for umpteen years now  my family is prone to getting cold sores  i ve been getting them since  st grade i m now   i only trust this product as all the other stuff out there is way to expensive and doesn t work carmex is fantastic and works in a very short time  i use every product on the line now i love it be it a high end lip balm  round ball ones or anyother that has been on the market for long carmex by far works the best than any other  i also noticed that it doesnt chap my lips if i stop using the product  i am not addicted to this mild but beautifully scemted charm   thankyou for pampering me carmex  i keep the jar next to my bed  it s my favorite thing i have found for my lips  it stays on all night  and i wake up with soft lips  i like the light scent  the way it feels  it works so well  this is also one of the best things in winter time  nothing else works as well  it is cheap  bit not cheaply made  budget friendly fantasticness i love this product  my family has been using this product for years and every time i see a jar it brings back old memories from when i was a child  i love that they have not veered from being their original self and are still a brand my family trust to this day  great product and you can always count on it to help protect your pucker i have been using carmex for over ten years and i am lost without it  there is two jars in my purse  one in my car and one in my desk drawer at all times  i have not had a cold sore  chapped lips or flaky lips from the sun in these ten years  people talk about their daily exercising  well my daily care includes a dip for my lips  carmex maybe more a question then the review  i have been using original carmex for years  recently i bought   pots of it and i was shocked  as my beloved salve seem different  smell texture and feel is rather questionable  this is a lot   please tell me you have not change the formula i m a girl that adores her chap stick  though my trusty sidekick did nothing to fight off my extremely chapped lips that i had last week  i bought a jar of carmex and with only a few applications  my very dry lips were back to normal in   hours  thank you  i always buy at least   jars of carmex to have on hand    are at home and   is in my purse at all times  winter weather is fast approaching and i have severe dry lips and usually get a cold sore at some point and carmex softens and protects my lips throughout the winter months  very reliable and trustworthy to get the protection done i ve used this carmex in the original jar for as long as i can remember  my mom started us on it when we were little and to this day it is still my go to for chapped or dry lips and just a good moisturizer over all and i love the menthol  there is nothing else like it  i have one in my truck and one on my nightstand at all times as soon as a cold snap occurs  it time to buy jars of carmex  leave it in bathroom  kitchen and bedroom  this way you have access to it  all the time  the climate gets very dry   and zaps your lips  for me  carmex is never out of reach   the best product to keep your lips from chapping especially when shoveling in cold winter months i have bought so many of these in the past years having a son in the military this was a life saver for when he was in iraq and afgahanintan he was my oldest and then my middle son uses this daily and has started his daughter to use it and my yougest uses this also and of course i do too thanks for having such a great product this original carmex has been around since i was a child  i remember i used to get painful chapped lips from playing outside during the winter when i was little and my mom would always use this product to help heal soothe my lips  it is a product that has stood the test of time and is still available today and for that i am thankful i have been using this for years  my lips are always very soft and this is the only lip care item that prevents fever blisters for me  my   year old daughter swears by it too  i buy   at a time to make sure we always have plenty on hand  i have bought more expensive products and always come back to my carmex  i love this stuff i have been using carmex in the small glass jar  i believe it is plastic now  for many many years  i have always loved the distinctive smell of carmex and the tingle when i piut it on  the jar may seem tiny  but it lasts for a long time  i have carmex by my bed and in my purse and i have even tried carmex lotion and love it too how can you go without using the carmex in the original yellow jar  i use carmex all day long  a preserver for my lips   days a year  even my dentist keeps the jar in the drawer for patients to keep moist lips  i drive every other week to atlanta and the carmex is always with me  a life saver and preserver for me and my family i was   when i first started to use it  i went to visit my granny and got a really bad cold sore  she got carmex for me and the cold sore was gone in three days  i have been using it ever since and i m   now happy i love the jar becuase i love touching my lips and i love the idea of being able to control the amount of carmax you want on your finger  the jar is also most ideal when wanting to share with friends and family as you don t have to worry about their lips touching your stick  each person gets their own individual amount  the jar is the best  also if you happen to get a cold sore you don t have to scrape of the top layer on the stick wasting product as to prevent the cold sore from coming back and spreading  using a jar keeps your lips from wasting product having cold sores has to be one of the worst and discomforting things ever  when i first tried carmex  i immediately felt relief  really it s indescribable how awesome carmex is  i have used pretty much every other line of chapstick or any lip reliever in the market l  but none have come close to carmex  since i started using carmex  that s all i use  i keep two in my purse and i keep at home as well  my lips are finally kissable  thanks to carmex  thank you for such an amazing product  god bless you guys for helping so many i use to suffer from very dry  cracked lips year round for years  i have tried every brand on the market  websites  by chance i saw this product gave it a try wow  i ve used this every day night for the past   yrs  the pain  discomfort is a non issue    it keeps my lips hydrated  no chance for cold sores  my lips are ready each day  thank you so very much for this awesome product  i ve shared these as stocking suffers for all my friends and family  the cost is so reasonable also  thank you again from happy lips in cuyahoga falls  ohio   i use this product particularily in the cold winter months  and it does a great job of protecting my lips from the weather  i put this thick gel  a little goes a long way  under lipcolor during the day  generously on my lips as a conditioning treatment during the night  and on the skin near my nose when i m sick that gets dried and irritated from blowing my nose  this product works and is a budget friendly staple for anyone s makeup collection  my only complaint is i m not a fan of the smell  in the future would love a less stinky medicated scent i usually always buy carmex when it comes to lip balm and the original jar is one of my go to carmex products  i do love the cherry and tubes but the jar is very convenient to have around  and less likely to lose  it lasts forever as well  i apply it every day  multiple times a day and it still looks like i haven t made a dent in the product after a month  it keeps my lips moisturizer for hours and doesn t leave a greasy residue or doesn t feel sticky like other lip balms do  highly recommend this to keep at your desk for work or in your purse i know people claim that carmex is addictive  and i know that you claim it s not  either way  i love it  i slather virtually half of my face with it prior to bed each night  i don t wear it during the day  because i don t like feeling the least bit greasy  anyway  i just wanted to tell you that i love carmex  i once forgot to bring my carmex with me on business trip  and i was stuck buying an over priced chapstick in a hotel lobby  and boy  is that stuff junk  it felt like i was spreading old cheese on my lips  this is an any day must have are used to lick my lips causing them to become extremely dry with a dark ring around my mouth and my lips peeling   my cousin suggested that i try carmax this has been years ago   i now carry comex everyplace i go it s in my car in my purse beside my bed i can t be without it it has become my best friend my lips are no longer dry sore or cracking i would recommend this product to everyone my  year old nephew man uses it because he was experiencing the same problems i had it he no longer has that problem thank you i ve used the carmex original in the lip balm jar for as long as i can remember  ever since someone introduced it to me either in late elemtary or middle school  so many many memories are associated with this simple little product that has grown up with me for   years  i love how it s never really changed except for some minor changes to the jar during those years until now these genius additions to the line that has only made it better thank you carmex for being there being such an important part of my ever changing life i can t even tell you how many years i have been using the carmex tub  but i will never use anything else  i love carmex  i am totally addicted to it and my lips are always so soft  i put it on every night before bed and my lips are good the whole day  i have tried so many different products for chapped lips and this is by far the absolute best product on the market  the price and quality of the product are incredible  the other ones out there don t work and cost too much money  keep it up guys  i love you i have been using carmex in it s familiar pot since high school  i remember it like yesterday  the girls gathered in the ladies room between classes to gossip  giggle  brush our hair and put on carmex to soften our lips  we had to be ready just in case the cute boy we crushed on spoke to us  we wouldn t be kissing in class  but  we followed the ritual so our lips would be perfect  i still love the feeling of it on my lips and taking that  st inhale  that makes your lips tingle and your thoughts travel to a sweet memory i love keeping a jar at home for use before bed or if i need it during the night  i also keep a jar for each of my kids especially during the winter  when lips get chapped the most  they lick their lips and cause that ring around the mouth that this product helps get rid of fast  they keep theirs by their beds in case they need it during night also  i like the how smooth it is and the scent is also very pleasant  my kids like the smell of it especially when having a cold  it seems to help them clear their nose better i remember back when i was a small child  my father would always be on my case about putting carmex on my lips because they were always so sore and chapped  of course a   year old wouldn t care  until the winter came  my lips were so chapped and i started getting cold sores all over my mouth  so i finally listened to my dad about putting carmex on my lips  ever since i started   i never stopped  carmex is such an amazing product   my lips have never again got crusty and i haven t had a sore since elementary school i began using carmex in high school  i had really bad acne and started an acne treatment that really dried my face and lips out  the dermatologist told me to use carmex  i am now   years old and i still use it  i have to put it on in the morning after applying my makeup  and reapply several times throughout the day  then after i have removed my makeup for the night and right before i go to bed  i reapply  i cannot go to sleep without it  my husband uses it almost as much as i do  excellent product  thank you when i open a jar of carmex  i can t wait for the cooling smell it has  soft as butter  goes on like silk  protects my lips from wind  rain  and sun  i wear it to sleep to keep my lips moist and supple  i even use it in my nose when the house is dry to keep it loose and soft  i think carmex is the best on the market  low in price  high in quality  i ve used it for many years  when my kids were little i would use it for cold sores and chapped lips and cheeks  keep up the excellent work  sincerely tina d utecht i ve been using the pot carmex since the  s  i have loved it all these years  back in the day anyone we were with would say  can i use your carmex it was the only lip protection referred to  someone always had carmex on them  after all these years  the pot carmex has not lost it s fabulous ness  there s just something about applying carmex to your lips with your finger  try it to see how smooth it glides on to all the right places for instant relief  and a healthy little shine to your lips i have been using carmex for over   years because i get cold sores every year and i have used nexcare and abreava and those are way expensive too and i noticed that those take a week for your cold sore to hear and so i tried the carmex and it s like gone in a day  i actually got a cold sore yesterday   and it s gone today  i told my daughter about it a while back because she had a sore and she even used it  i even recommend it to a lady at the store but i don t think she took my word for it so  i bought my first carmex three years ago i think  because i saw a friend had it  i just love it  i use it when i wake up  during the day when needed and before i go to bed  my lips haven t been dry in three years  how amazing isn t that i have used one of this jar  and i am halfway through the second one  so one and a half jar in three years   amazing  i also got the cherry one recently and i love the scent of it  ah  this product is just perfect and i really recommend it to everyone i have been using this particular carmex product for several years  the original lip balm jar has been a staple in my purse and in my   kids christmas stockings every year for the past several years  three of my kids are grown and they still want carmex for christmas  i give them several jars so they have it all year  this product keeps lips from chapping in the minnesota cold and also from the arkansas heat    i have lived several years in both states  i love this product so much the name says it all  the original that started all of this carmex craze  i don t know about all of you  but i graduated in   carmex has been going strong for years  even since i was in school lol love it can t live without it  also  all the other carmex products flavors are totally amazing  i just figured i would go with the original because it is the single product that started these amazing products  that actually do their job do it properly  thank you carmex if you never tried it  it s time for you to do it  keep your lips moist and healthy i m going to do a review on the  st product made by carmex  because this one is the first one i have ever tried  it s what got me hooked on this lip balm where it all started  i tried this product when i was   years old  my lips were so chapped that it was so painful and red  as soon as my aunt and uncle purchased it for me  it stopped my pain right away and within a couple of days  it was gone  i have never had a problem with this product and as of today i still carry carmex in my purse  a  for this product made by carmex and it s affordable  thank you for making my life easier  your   fan lia anderson  from flint  mi i grew up in a skating rink  that means i had multiple mothers and fathers watching out and over us  it also means i had multiple grandmothers that were willing to share their knowledge  this product is part of their knowledge    years later and i am still using this product religiously  i keep it in my pocket  i keep it in my hunting backpack  i keep it in my truck console  i keep it on the nightstand  i mean this product is within reach   not only does it help with crack and chapped lips  it also helps with cold sores  i now share my knowledge and love for this product every chance i get  great great product always use this and it works a treat however there is a massive dent built in the bottom of the classic jar which makes it look like you are getting more for your money  the squeezie tube is better value for money   same price with more product i ve been using carmex for the past two years  this product keeps your lips moist and smooth  i got to say that before i started using carmex i normally used to get cold sores and other cold sore products did not help at all  i tried all of them  like abreva and spent so much money on products like that and my cold sores took a long time to heal or got worse  my friend told me about carmex  so i tried carmex when i had the sores and i it was amazing how my sore was diminishing and was gone so quickly  i always keep carmex in my bag  dresser  in my car  definitely would recommend this product to friends and family i am prone to severe chapped lips  if i don t use chap stick every day my lips dry out to the point that they crack and bleed  unlike most chap sticks which work for a few hours then need to be reapplied  every   or   hours  the carmex jar is long lasting  i can put it on twice a day  before work and before bed  and my lips are fine sometimes i can even get do fine using it just once a day if the weather isn t harsh  if its really cold or dry i still only need to use chap stick mid day once when i use the carmex morning and night  which is a vast improvement  i love it  added bonus the jar is my favorite color i bought my carmex jar about a month or so ago because i live in georgia and it s so easy to get dry lips with this hot  dry weather  so  i decided to try it out  after one week my boyfriend and i both noticed changes and my lips are so soft now  he however doesn t like carmex do to the oily feeling and the taste to him is rather undelightful  however one day i left my jar in the car by accident and when i came back it was melted  the hear from outside actually fully melted it  but after bringing it inside it came right back to life and have had no problems with it  i was rather happy about that i ve tried countless lip care products from countless brands across different price points  and nothing beats the carmex original jar  it instantly soothes dry lips and regular application helps keep your lips looking and feeling great  this formulation is great to use year round as it s emollient both in colder and hotter weather  do yourself a favor and apply as liberally and as often as possible  you won t regret it i just brought this carmex lip balm because my lips are very chapped and dry and i love it and it s cute little container that i can store pretty much anywhere i have never used a lip balm as much as this one and have only had it for   days and i have already seen a improvement in my lip moisture and no other lip balm has shown that much improvement for me so soon and i have stocked up and brought like   more to last me for a month i hope but i might need more but i like how it feels minty or refreshing on my lips so i plan on sticking with your product because it s perfect for me  i have used carmex for many years but for a while i had forgot about it and it got pushed to the back of a draw  however recently i found it and remembered how moisturising it is on the lips and that great tingly minty feeling the balm gives you  i always have dry chapped lips but using carmex has allowed my lips to heal and make them feel soft  now i could not live with out it i have a jar in all of my bags and around my house and apply it multiple times a day and before bed i apply a generous amount to work as a lip mask over night to give me luscious lips in the morning i am a lifelong carmex user  not only does it keep my lips from drying and cracking during the searing summer months and frigid winter months  but when i used to play in the marching band  it was an indispensable tool i would never go without  playing a wind instrument in extreme weather conditions can be murder on your lips but carmex s invigorating healing power kept my lips fresh  safe  and protected   even under the most punishing conditions  it doesn t wear off easily like some other brands and you can actually feel it healing your lips immediately this stuff works miracles i ve used this product in the pot for over   yrs til it came out in a tube  i ve used the tube ever since  i ve tried everything on the market and nothing works like it does  i still don t like the smell or flavor but i m hooked  i ve tried the cherry and didn t care for it at all  have you every thought about vanilla or mint in the tube because i find the vanilla in the stick to be the right smell flavor but i don t like the texture and it doesn t last like the original on your lips  thank you i have tube all over my house and everywhere i go  if not i have to stop and buy some this product is awesome  my nose and lips were raw from a nasty cold  carmex soothed and healed this severe chapped skin in seconds  i was looking for a product with the healing product of lanolin and was pleased to find it is the second main ingredient  thanks to carmex i m back to feeling great i discovered carmex original lip balm more than ten years ago  since then i ve never used a different brand  the soothing difference is like night day  i am constantly recommending carmex lip balm to all my friends even acquaintances that display an immediate need to get some relief from chapped lips cold sores  as i know beyond a reasonable doubt that i end up a hero  without exception they love it  too can t believe they ve just discovered it  i always have an unopened unused tube with me that i then give to the newest convert  the love is overwhelming  thanks carmex i ve exclusively used carmex for   yrs  it s the last thing i do before going to bed at night  my lips have not been chapped once in all those years  there soft and supple always  i prefer the original pot over all the other carmex  not only is it on my bedside table but in my purse  it s always with me  i ve three daughters that use it before going to sleep at night  and it is with them everyday of the year also  all i can say is that it is simply the best lip product ever  i recommend it always when someone has chapped or dry lips or just want smooth soft lips always you don t know how lucky you are to have carmex lip balm in a jar  i came to texas from miles away to find lips here are spoiled every day  they are being moistened with a balm that makes my red and inflamed lips  super calm  plesant aroma that is second to none  and pretty soon you will have yours all gone  not to fear tho carmex lip balm in a jar  cuz everyone here knows who you are  just ask and you will see who has that balm takes only seconds and its in your lucky little palm  i love carmex lip balm  never fails to heal my lips and keep them soft and moist this is the only product that heals cold sores completely  i had never had a cold sore before  but a few weeks ago  there it was  i went to the pharmacy and bought an expensive medicine specifically for cold sores  not only did it not work  but actually made my lips itchy  as i have been using carmex for years for my dry and chapped lips  i thought  okay  i ll give it a try on this cold sore  like magic  it s gone  this is a phenomenal product  and i am super grateful to the people at carmex for consistently making high quality products  from my lips i say  thank you i found this product back in the  s  i walked into my local drug store looking for something that would work better on chapped lips fever blisters  my go to was chap stick before finding carmex  i found carmex to be so soothing restorative for my lips  i use it under lipstick or by itself everyday  for me  it keeps fever blisters manageable if i get one  super moisturizing in any weather  i never leave home without one form of it in my pocket or handbag  this lip balm jar is my go to now before bed  please never change your product  it works it works well my sisters used to use this all the time  they ran through jar upon jar of it as i was growing up  considering i was a good   years younger than them  i just thought they were weird teenagers  but when i turned   i was on the swim team at school  and the other girls were using it for their chapped lips  we had horribly dry lips due to the constant lap swimming we did in all weather   times a week  and after   days we had amazing lips  this stuff is the real deal  the girls who didn t use carmex were looking a little raw faced at our trials  we used it even on our cheeks to help with windburn  and it was phenomenal for elbows too  it really does work for everything  and now i know why we had so many empty tiny yellow jars everywhere after many years of using various other lip balms  discovering carmex was a game changer  i will never use another lip balm when i bought the new carmex that s in a pkg  rather than how they used to sell it in an open box i noticed that it went up in price  not a big deal  since that happens with time  everything seems to go up  but what i was upset about was that  even though it looks like the same jar  if you look underneath  the indentation goes up so far  that it is about half of what you used to get  i have an old glass jar  and compared to the new plastic one  the indentation on the bottom is at least half way up  now i ve noticed the ones that are not in pkgs  have a tight plastic sticker on the bottom to cover up that fact  i haven t bought any carmex since  i was going to email the company  but they sent me an email to review their product i have been using this for at least   and a half decades  and love it to death  my only complaint is that i actually miss the old glass containers it came in  fortunately i still have one  and often fill it up with the contents from the new plastic container  while i know it is the same stuff as before  i really miss the white glass containers it came in  even though i know the new plastic containers are safer  i still like the nostalgia of those glass containers great product better then abreva  price is fair better then most products let me first start by saying that i have suffered from severe chapped lips for as long as i can remember  i literally layers of skin peeling off from my lips little by little  suffice to say  it can be quite painful  while i visited my doctor  i brought up my issue and he commanded carmex  i was a bit skeptical but i went for it anyways  i have tried so many remedies before to no avail so why not another attempt well  let me tell you this is my very last attempt because carmex has improved my condition tremendously  it is not only soothing and moisturizing but helped with the peeling and the chapped lips  now my lips are baby soft  supple and stays hydrated for long hours  i could not ask for a better lip balm my wife bought this cream a few month ago and to be honest i was under the impression that it would be like all the other balms  oh boy was i wrong  this little wonder balm is the cure to my chapped limps and the cure to my cold sores  yes cold sores  in fact it beats all other cold sore medication out there  when i use regularly  meaning i don t lose my jar like i often do  it prevents chapped lips and cold sores from reappearing  plus i love the tingling sensation you get after you apply it  i recommend it to all my friends  now that i found this product  my pharmacy does not carry it anymore  now i have to find another place to get it  with the help of the website i think i found a solution  thank you carmex ever since i was little i have used carmex as my go to chapstick  i love everything about it and i could never find a better lip balm  it s not just something to put on your lips when your lips are dry it also works wonders if your lips are cracked or hurting from being too dry  this product is a must have in your purse at all times  love love i purchased this delightful little jar approximately two weeks ago  in preparation for the impending winter months  and the inevitably chapped and cracked lips  in the vast world we all live in today  we are often overwhelmed by the huge number of choices we are faced with every day  even when it comes to something as simple as which chap stick we want to purchase  i can t thank carmex enough for forever making this little choice easier for me by creating a lip balm that is by and far above the rest  their simple yet elegant design combined with their no nonsense  get the job done formula make this the obvious choice for anyone looking to have healthy  happy lips throughout the holiday season my lips are almost always chapped without carmex  i ve had dry and chapped lips for so long and i ve tried everything  blistex  eos  chapsticks  lucas  pawpaw and even medicated lip ointments  i recently picked up a carmex over an  instinctual urge  and i don t think i ve ever looked back since  carmex does wonders for my lips  they re so smooth and soft now   even my boyfriend has commented on them  the consistency is just right  not too thin and not too thick  i ve found with lucas  pawpaw  it s only good for chapped lips and blistex and eos only gives me a thin layer of lip balm  i like to apply lip balm before i sleep because my room sits at a cool   degrees celsius  i find that because of the consistency  carmex really absorbs and heals your lips while you sleep  blistex leaves a thin coating on my lips when i wake up whilst pawpaw doesn t absorb very well either and sometimes dries out my lips even more  i recommend this little tub of goodness to everyone and anyone who is looking for a great lip balm or lip remedy  i ve only needed to apply it   times daily  and i have extremely dry and chapped lips from my medication and it works wonders for me  i really love my little tub of carmex and it s by far one of the best lip remedies i ve picked up   at such an affordable price as well i was introduced to this product back in the  s and this is yet by far the best product that i have used and will ever use  it keeps my lips moist and supple  i go out of my way when my pharmacy that i shop does not have my product  however i have learned now for years is to stock up  and that is exactly what i do  thanks to carmex for this unique and exquisite product  i d love to be entered into a commercial if you d allow me   smile  i recommend this to all i encounter  lastly  you have gotten a bit expensive and really there was no need  people who have used your product know quality  but i think your prices are getting a bit profuse  nonetheless i do stand by you  excellent for dry cracked lips  great product  love it i started using carmex when i moved back home to chicago in   a co worker at the hospital turned me onto carmex  she told me it was a staple for winters in chicago  i have used it ever since and i live in the southeast now  it s not just good for sore chapped winter lips it s perfect for surfing  a lipstick base or gloss  or just dry lips  believe me  just ask my hubby  i have jars in all my cars and my purses and stashed everywhere so it s always handy  i ve traveled the world with my original carmex in the jar  carmex has been with me to mexico  jamaica  the bahamas  and all over the usa  i turn everyone on to carmex that i spark conversation with while traveling  my mom would always keep this jar of carmex stocked in our bathrooms and nothing else was used in our house  well  i am all grown up now and i had run out of my beloved carmex in a jar  hubby came home with some other brand that was immediately thrown in the trash  he obviously did not understand my love for the familiar soothing scent  the way it immediately took care of my dry lips and the yellow cover with the white pot  i found it in the store  picked up five checked out  in the car  tore into one of those wrappers  opened one of those pots and that familiar friend was back  my chapped lips were slathered with the soothing lip balm once again beginning in about  rd grade   approx   every fall i would be cursed w  a huge reddish purple ring around my mouth from having severely dry lips literally using my upper lower lips as my chap aid  spending the afternoon w  my grandmother  she stopped at a local pharmacy to buy me a tube of chapstick the pharmacist helping her suggested that we try a new aid handed her a little yellow tin tub of carmex suggested we try it  i used it non stop for the next few days  and amazed my whole family w  how well fast carmex did the job  i have used nothing else ever since  my lips belong solely to carmex  many thanks carmex i have been an avid user of carmex in the pot for the last   years  i was living in wisconsin when i started using this product in high school in the  s  i then moved to florida and they did not have carmex in the state of florida  i was distraught and had to have my mother send me shipments of carmex so i could survive  i have a pot of carmex in every room of my house  my car  my purses   everywhere  i have tried all of the other lip products out there and the only one i find absolutely reliable everytime is carmex  my lips have stayed so soft for so many years and i never have chapped lips  carmex is the best thing since sliced bread i have used carmex original lip balm  in the little round jar  for many years and it has always come through for me  there are not many products out there  that i have found  that work consistently and do exactly what they claim to do  but this one does  at the first hint of a cold sore  i grab the carmex as quickly as i can  and apply it  it stops the cold sore from progressing and heals what is trying to pop out  if i can t find my little jar  i panic and hurry to the store to buy another one   no one wants to go around with an ugly cold sore  i ve always thought it amazing that a product that works so well  would be so affordable i got my carmex the first time i started having really chapped lips and it works wonder when taking this acne medication called roaccutane which causes lips to be dehydrated  the orange flavor liquid lip conditioning tube has worked wonders for me these days  i also used the original jar but right now i don t remember where i put it so i haven t used it  from what i remember it has a nice refreshing scent and also calms your lips from burning due to the extreme dryness so i recently moved from pennsylvania to colorado  huge elevation difference  a few days ago  a friend and i went to garden of the gods and i failed to bring chapstick  the result was me linking my lips way too much and i suffered tremendously the next day  my lips were on fire  the day after that  my lips were so severely chapeed  i didn t even want to go to work  well  of course i went  and i bought this little miracle in a jar  within just a few hours  my lips were   better  still chapped as they needed to heal but i was so shocked at how quickly carmex soothed my lips  amazing  i love it i love this product  i would definitely recommend it somehow i found this balm in romania  in a little store  i decided to buy it  the jar was so interesting  the price was good  too  but i must admit  my expectations weren t very high  i have a lot of lip balms  and none of them really works  and then  such a big surprise  the menthol  the camphor  these aren t very usual for lip balms  but they did a good job with my lips  together with the other ingredients  it became my favourite balm in the world  i would be sooo happy to try the other products  but  unfortunately  it s impossible to buy these from here  and to bring them from the usa it s too expensive i buy these tubs by the dozen at a time  i use my carmex   and carry it with me wherever i go  can t leave home without my carmex   product works wonders at keeping my lips from chapping and keeps my lips supple and soft  thank you carmex   and yes in my picture  my carmex is in my coat pocket  i am in love with this lip balm  the original pot version  i love the way it makes my lips feel  it makes them feel fresh  smooth  soft  this is the only lip balm that doesnt irritate my lips  other lip balms and glosses leave my lips numb and itchy  this doesn t  its like a miracle in a jar  i never get cold sores  but i use this like an everyday lip balm  it is wonderful  if you like wearing lipstick  and sometimes have those annoying dry peeling lips  put some of this on your lips while your getting ready  then wipe it of and apply lipstick  i like that its not oily greasy like the blistex in the jar  carmex has the perfect texture  the smell is like the original chapstick smell  lol it kind of reminds me of the smell of a new baby doll s skin  kind of powdery in a way  but i like it  it s so cheap  only   cents at my walmart  so worth buying  you wont be disappointed  you can also use it on dry hands as well  it s long lasting too i bought this and it s always working the best on my lips  i love that when i wipe it off my lips are soft with no cracks and it helps with all my sores  this product is the best i bought this like a month ago and recommendations wasn t as well i have been using carmex since the  s when my mother introduced me to it  i in turn introduced it to my husband  he cannot do without it  due to his addiction we probably keep     jars stashed around the house and in the cars  one on each side of the bed  one in the bathroom  one in each of our cars  there is always at least   in the laundry room  freshly laundered    in his desk drawer and a couple of brand new ones  just in case  my only disappointment was the day i went to buy an new jar and the package felt different  my beloved jar was now plastic  my little wonderfully feeling porcelain  i believe  jar was gone  i have to admit  that month i searched for my beloved jar in every store i went  in the hopes that they had not sold out of them  only to be replaced by the new plastic jar  i don t know about anyone else  but i would gladly pay an uncharge to have my beloved and true classic original jar back once again im happy with this product works well especially on dry lips i used to use the cherry chapstick from the brand chapstick and their cakebatter flavored one as well  but i stuggled with them in combination  one would work or the other would but neither were helping me  so eventually i searched for something new to help relive my dry almost papery lips  i tried the original carmex and i was in love after the first two days  i put it on as soon as i got it and slept with it overnight  when i woke up it was like my lips were never damaged  i love carmex and thank you so much i have bought this lip balm few days ago  never heard of it before  best product ever  fell in love with it immediately carmex delivers like no other lip balm  hands down best product i have been using carmex original lip balm in the jar since i was a child  i remember my mom getting out the little tub of carmex putting on my lips before i went out the door  winter  spring  summer  or fall  when i was a teen there would always be a little jar in my christmas stocking along with a tube now that i wanted to wear lip gloss  i never went to lip gloss  just my carmex  as my own daughters came i would put a little carmex on their lips before they left the house too they got a little tub in their christmas stockings  now i have granddaughters who get a little carmex on their lips before they go out from me their moms  they also get a little jar flavored tubes in their christmas stockings  all these years later at   yrs old it s still my go to lip quencher season after season a christmas stocking favorite it was in annasiriya  iraq that i was introduced to carmex and have been a true believer ever since  we were pulling security at the ziggurat of ur while the iraqi s had their very first meeting at an attempt at self governance  we were in the hot sun all day and at the end of the day i had a blister on my lip that looked like a cigarette had been put out on my lip  a fellow soldier suggested carmex  i was given some and it worked like a charm healing this burn and preventing any more burns  since that time  may   i returned to southern iraq in   and spent january   to february   in kandahar province afghanistan  and every time i took a good supply of carmex that saved my lips from burning from the extreme sun found in the area i told everyone that if they wanted to send me a care package to please send some carmex my friend bought it for me and it feels good on the lips my grandfather and father both used this product  i ve used it my whole life  it not only is a multipurpose product but it brings me back and remind she me of my loved ones  i love carmex  especially the jar  please don t go anywhere  ever i m from a generation of wisconsin families who have had carmex original lip balm jars faithfully in their pocket  purse  backpack  and bathroom for over   years  from harsh winter weather to scorching summer sun  along with dry lips and a few cold sores thrown in between  carmex has relieved it all  from the first sight of the jar wanting to be opened  to that unique sound of the tiny lid being screwed off with a pleasant aroma that greets you  and finally to the tingly lip sensation after application it s happiness to my senses  i use it instead of lipstick for a natural shine several times throughout the day  and at night before bedtime to avoid chapped dry lips  the carmex original lip balm jar will continue to be one of my wisconsin traditions that i ll highly recommend to my family and friends i have always gotten horrific fever blisters and tried everything to soothe them   if you re not aware  they are very painful   anyways  a friend of mine asked me if i had ever tried carmex and i hadn t and had honestly given up hope that anything would ever work  so  i was out at my local drug store and seen the carmex and picked up a jar as a last ditch effort   boy  was i so glad that i did  carmex has been a life saver for me  i know that sounds shallow  but it s the truth  i felt immediate results and my fever blisters healed quickly and the carmex soothed them  needless to say  i have jars and tubes of carmex every where in my house  car  purses  etc  you can never have enough  i use it multiple times a day and my lips are so smooth and protected  thank you for such a wonderful product  carmex carmex is my favorite lip balm ever  it always helps my chapped lips  i love it its great i love using it  but i suggest you guys make a bigger jar or a family sized jar so it can last longer my lips always keep super dry during the winter regardless of how much water i drink  i ve gone three days with chap  awful lips and finally remembered to pick up carmex  it never lets me down  i m sitting here now with soft  soothed lips and it reminds me of how when you re super sick as a child and your mom comforts you  normal chapstick never does the job  if people taking the time to write reviews about a lip balm tells you something  it s something positive i remember when i first was introduced to carmex  my mother put it on our chapped lips in the winter  i remember the tingling feeling on my lips and i loved it  i still use it today  and when friends ask me what do i use  instead of the usual chapstick or whatever else most people use  i always say carmex because it works well  it s actually the only lipcare that i use also perfect as a base before i put on lipstick  it just absolutely works  that s it  a lot of other brands work for an hour or few  but with carmex your lips stay moisturized well  and helps to prevent cold sores  although i don t get them  it s nice to know that it also will care for them  not only fo rthe cooler months  but all seasons  especially when winter comes  carmex it is love carmex  but really wish it had spf protection when my lips need soothing  carmex does the trick helps to soothe my extremely dry and cracked lips i use it everyday  it makes your lips smooth and soft i started using in the summer my lips are so soft keeps lips moist for a long while but could be better love this product  the packaging  even like the smell i bought this awhile ago and i love it  it is great i buy this all the time  it s a wonderful product carmen is great all the time  especially when ur sick i love the jar  its so the best product ever  i loveit my go to lip balm  long lasting and always sooths this is the most effective product i have tried yet bought this product a while ago  and its the best choice ive ever made i bought this last month and my lips feel fantastic i got this about   to   weeks ago and i love love it best chapstick that i have found i have

this product lasted me   whole months i love it carmex is the best product ever  everything they make is worth purchasing and using helps the lips to blend in and moisture              great stuff for winter months love it works wonders love it was so happy a good chorizo should color your cooking oil red when fried in a pan  this chorizo does not  don quijote is much better but more expensive and getting harder to find  what a shame that we cannot buy a good chorizo here in the united states anymore its ok but i like a more roboust red wine for cooking i ve been dreaming of making a red wine reduction for years  finally did it for valentines for my then boyfriend  it was a hit  too bad he wasn t worth all that effort in the end  regardless  it was a perfect meal and this stuff helped make it so this is a good cooking wine unless you want to save it in the refrigerator  in a few days  it loses its taste have bought an eight pack of white grape juice to have on hand instead of getting this again i think it was great with prirmerib nothing wrong with goya cooking wine  it s great  what s wrong here is the price  i can buy this exact product at my supermarket for  as advertised great cooking what we needed wonderful  we moved to a small town and i could no longer buy goya cooking wines locally  love the wine for cooking and the larger bottles are far more affordable than buying multiple smaller bottles of other brands  wish i had thought of amazon months ago i was a big balsamic fan but this is now my go to for salad dressing this item is available in the mt prospect  il store it is not out of stock  the fillets are extra firm and do not fall apart like some other varieties i have bought  i like the flavor of the fillets  i have bought the bar harbor fillets in wine sauce and did not care them it says a discount for   bottles  then even shows reduced price but when you check out price changes tastes is so good this has got to be one of the best cabinet i have ever had great taste crisp i originally bought three bottles i wound up buying a whole case just for the holidays this cab is fantastic  i was pleasantly  surprised  great full bodied flavor  with   cent shipping promotion  the price is decent bought this red wine  for me  my holiday present  i love the crush version of apothic s red blend  super flavor  it was less expensive to have   bottles shipped to me then to buy them at the local store very nice wine   a little lighter than there other reds it is a not dry  very smooth  so you can taste the berry and cherry very well  says it has communion and caramel in it but i couldn t taste either  it is so good  i got a buzz after one glass  it is   so if you drink slow  you should be fine  i do not care for too sweet or dry  this makes this blend perfect i have been drinking this apothic california crush for the past six months and find it totally refreshing  it is so smooth and flavorable  one bottle is usually not enough and i tend to buy six bottles at a time  fortunately the price in alaska is much cheaper which makes it even more desirable this ointment works fine for dry eye  my only downfall is that it has a metal tip applicator  if it were plastic like the other similar products then i would give it   stars i stumbled across this a few years ago  and now it s all we use when we can buy it  great on hot dogs  brats  and the like  it s great to find out that we can order for store pick up at walmart  we would highly recommend to anyone that likes a little more kick than normal yellow mustard  to be clear  it is not too spicy at all  we think it is outstanding awesome mustard  i ve been using this brand for several years on german brats i get from a little place in wisconsin  this review was collected as part of a promotion silver springs has the best spicy mustard ever  can t find it locally anymore   and the value was great  no better tasting mustard on a brat i brought the rose  and cab  i just opened the rose  and it was just as advertised   not too sweet  that s the reason i don t drink rose s they are either too dry or too sweet  however  this was mildly sweet and not dry at all and very smooth  getting ready to do auto ship  i m a wine snob and yet i would serve this to a group and my personal wine connoisseur i purchased the   bottle harvest collection several weeks ago at the insane low price of   i tried the pinot noir last night and it was fantastic  i am looking forward to giving most away as gifts for the upcoming holiday season  you cannot go wrong with these wines  have a great day everyone really good wine and i have already ordered again perfect gift for my father for the holidays  been a family favorite for a long time i have never been so happy to receive a package as i was to receive the sampler pack from barefoot wine  it was an extremely busy time and i needed a boost  the package was delivered as promised and as described and was chilled  i will purchase again i like some of these but others had strange tastes  my favorite which is not in this mix  is the sweet red blend think this was a good purchase although i had nary a drop   must have been a very good choice too  because it s on a list to be ordered again i ve purchased barefoot cellars many times and this sampler was a great buy  the price was perfect and getting a chance to sample a little bit of everything is even better  my package came boxed very well and in my set i received a bottle of pinot grigio champagne  saving for special occasion  i had a glass of the chardonnay last night with dinner and it was so refreshing  i ve had a variety of whites and have tried to find something that i could have with a nice meal or alone  i am not a fan of white wines  but this one was perfect  definitely could have a glass of this alone while reading a good book getting christmas presents to friends and family in the usa  from the uk  can be frustrating  established gift companies often charge over the odds for the items they sell  but this barefoot cellars sampler case is great value  and we re told that it tasted great  a nice easy transaction and secure delivery  just as promised  made for satisfying gifting to old friends  many thanks so great to be able to share barefoot wine with friends and family around the country  especially those who are new to wine and don t know which varietal they truly love  iworkhere i love the fact that i can now buy barefoot wine for my out of state friends and ship it directly to their house  iworkhere i really like the foot as a logo  the wine is good but that little foot  sooo cute  and its even on the corks  which weirdly i do save  thinking of making art out of them  i am an artist and would love to design something for wine bottles    maybe i better go have another glass now  thank you barerfoot cellars wine from amazon what s not to love taste of the selected wine was quite pleasing  it came with suggestions for paring with food  i was not disappointed smooth full bodied wines at a fair price gift for my almost  i hope  daughter in law  she was very happy i enjoyed reading the wine label and descriptions on the back of the bottle as much as drinking this wine  my favorite line was something about the mission of the company to save marriages this package arrived when they said it would   it was also packed beautifully   nothing broken i m not a red wine person  but even the pinot noir was superb  wish it was sold locally  but i would definitely order again we really enjoy this wine and the name is very unique  great for gifts  outstanding taste  would definitely recommend and purchase again  thanks just as david the host said the cab was awesome  not dry at all and nice body in the glass  i m going back for more i got the rose  very good  not too sweet but mellow  i m not a big wine drinker  it this is the best i drank in a long time  i m going to order more  i should have ordered with tsv i bought the rose as they said it was sweetit turned out to be tasteless and really dry  nasty also took over a week to get herei am tired of how long it takes packages to arrive i have purchased this wine with various cheaper brands and have liked it far more  seemed very sour to me  not mellow at all  plus  they did not mention that you need to sign for this wine during the presentation  just they now deliver to pa  i found this out while tracking   my luck i was home the day of delivery  will go to the local state store for my regular brand i was so happy to see rose lincluded in this set instead of sweet zinfandel  unfortunately this rose was sweeter than zinfandel  very disappointed this wine is not great  in my opinion  i know wine taste is subjective  and this is only my opinion  but to me the wines are harsh  not smooth  an   taste  not   like hosts claimed  i ll drink it  will not gift it as i had hoped to  and have cancelled my auto delivery  i bought the mixed box so i ve tried them all wish this could be a positive review but not this time found the reds to be lacking greatly in aroma  nose  and both with an unpleasant finish usually we have been pleased overall with the wines but this is a definite miss for us we love the onehope reds and are so excited to see the new labels  the pinot is perfect for this time of year  the cab and merlot are our year round go to s with dinner  cannot wait for the ups guy to role up drinking wine with a purpose i have tried the cabernet and the merlot  when i received these i followed the suggestion of letting the wine sit from shipping  and then to open and let sit in order to breathe  i felt the cabernet was still to young  it had a very strong bite to it  i don t consider myself an expert  but i know a wine i like and have been taught a lot and am still learning  the merlot on the other hand was much better  it was smooth and had a deep fruit flavor with mild tannins  i would continue buying this one  i have not tried the pinot noir yet  i m hoping this will be just as satisfying as the merlot was  i will add to my review once i ve opened the bottle  and most of all i love how this company takes some of the proceeds and gives them to wonderful causes  that alone is worth buying this shipping was excellent and so was the wine  it s nice to be able to purchase a good product and donate to charity at the same time  this is our second time purchasing the wine onehope creates delicious wines that all support amazing causes  these reds are great for entertaining or relaxing after a long day  rich and flavorful  each of these reds has their own unique quality  personally the merlot is my favorite  being able to get all of these great wines together is a great deal  treat yourself to these reds or send them as a gift  you won t be disappointed i absolutely love the onehope reds and this mixed pack is such a great deal between the discount and   cent shipping  this is my go to gift for anyone i know who appreciates great wine  i ve been a fan of this winery for a long time and love the sleek new labels love the new labels and also love knowing that with every sip  we are making a social impact  this is a great gift to send to family and friends  spreading the word about great wines and awesome causes they support ordering this wine was the first time i had ever ordered wine online  and i wasn t sure if i would really like the wines or not  well i loved all of them  even though i am not a huge fan of pinot noirs  i really like that this company donates a percentage of each wine purchased to a different charity  the company is all about sustainability and giving back  one hope is a company with a cause  and outstanding wine  there is just so much to love about this wine i ve been following and drinking onehope wines for a while now  i love bringing these to parties and introducing all my friends to delicious wines that help support so many causes  the pinot for paws is my favorite i almost cant believe all of the good reviews for these wines  we pretty much couldn t even drink them because they are so sweet  thick and jammy  like fruit juice  we started with the pinot noir and after a few sips  aerating and then a few more sips with dinner  we just poured it out  it did not resemble any pinot i ve had before  so we moved on to the cabernet   and it was almost the same thing  i haven t tried the merlot yet but not looking forward to it  if i had bought these at a local shop they would be returned  unfortunately  i that s not an option since they are open and mail order  maybe the rest can be frozen for cooking  i do love that this producer gives back to charities  more companies should follow their lead in that respect wine by mail  and such good  full bodied reds  i will buy again but along the way  i need a new corkscrew  my serviceable current one struggles with the tight packed corks  makes sense who wants leaky wine and re corking is no cinch  either i have wandered among the corkscrews sold on amazon  and have no idea how to choose  if you have a suggrstion  please leave it in comments  thanks love love love this wine  my friend threw an event and used onehope and ever since i have been hooked  bought the   pack as a thank you gift and it was a huge hit  love the fact that this company donates   to good causes  takes the guilt out of drinking  ha love the new labels and also love knowing that with every sip  we are making a social impact  this is a great gift to send to family and friends  spreading the word about great wines and awesome causes they support this is my  nd purchase of the mixed pack  first purchase were given away as individual gifts  decided to taste for my self  i m a pinot cab fan  the pinot was a little on the light side for me but as someone mentioned earlier  open and let sit for a while  it s definitely better  the cab is my favorite and i would purchase again  i shared the merlot with a merlot fan and they liked it a lot  since part of the proceeds go to various charities its worth the purchase arrived promptly and well packed  nice selection of wines which tasted very good  will be using this often as gifts  by going through amazon smile we can contribute to our designated smile cause and also do some good through donations made by one hope  it s a real win win situation the merlot was harsh  it has my throat burning like moonshine  never tasted wine like this before  hope it is just a bad bottle one of my favorite big reds  jammy  fruit forward  lush  berries  not too sweet  for our taste  tannic  in a good way  i alternate at the moment on a daily basis between apothic dark and gnarly head authentic black  both selling for   at ralphs   why would anyone buy online and pay double wow  i wanted a different kind of wine to serve to friends  unfortunately  for them  i opened the bottle of apothic dark before anyone arrived so i could taste it  by the time they showed up  there wasn t much of the apothic left to share  oops  they got the regular wine  this is now by far my favorite wine  by the way  if you like a sweet tickle pink kind of wine  this one is not for you i am not a fan of red wines  but i study nutrition and am learning about the health benefits of dark red wines  i got this at trader joe s with fingers crossed  when i opened the bottle  it smelled like espresso at breakfast  i found that odd  but i love coffee  so it gave me hope that i would like it  sipping this delicious beverage was like warm berries on a summer day  this wine is straight up comfort food  sublimely satisfying if you like blends  this is very good this is currently one of our favorite wines  we ve even recommended it to friends  it s moderately sweet without to much dryness at the end  the cork is actually black  which we thought was a nice touch love this deep rich but not sweet wine  my first taste was few months ago while visiting relatives in copperhill  tennessee  i was surprised with the wonderful  smooth taste and flavors  and happy to learn it was a california wine  upon returning to calfornia i ordered a case and shared this delicious hearty smooth wine with friends  apothic also makes a red wine that is not dark  it to is a smooth flavorful wine but not as rich and deep as the dark  it goes great with everything or nothing  enjoy  christina based on reading some of the reviews here  i considered canceling my order  i m very glad i did not  i just received my first shipment  and i have to say i am really enjoying this cabernet sauvignon  i m very glad i signed up for auto ship i realize this is an inexpensive bottle of wine but it is tasteless  will not buy wine from qvc again this is one of the best chards that i have had in a long time  very light and delicious  i have ordered another wine from qvc and this is the best yet  i am on automated ordering and i also changed it to every   days  you will not be disappointed i m not a wine expert  i m a novice  but this wine is delicious  so glad i ordered autoship wine was delicious  best buy ever we ve always had good luck with smoking loon and these wines were no exception  very flavorful this whole order was a nightmare from day one  after almost   weeks it came i wish it didn t i gifted   bottles to my son   when he sent me a text how awful it was   that he dumped it down the drain i was horrified to say the least  luckily it was my son because i bought these for holiday gifts  qvc needs more quality control for items like this we work hard for our money   spending it on something i will be dumping down the drain is not acceptable i was refunded my money but it still is very upsetting that this vintage wine estates sells such garbage to a reputable company like qvc i have tried the cab and it is acceptable for what i wanted   an after work glass of wine  put the pinot away as it is way too young to drink  the rose was refreshing  i have not tried the chardonnay yet  this group of wines worked for me in that   it was about the price of grocery store wine    it was delivered to my house  and   i get to try a variety of wines that i normally would not purchase  i marked that i would not recommend this as a gift only because everyone s palate is different   i do not usually give wine as a gift i have been waiting for this bundle  as the presentation indicated the rose is not that over bearing sweet  just in the middle and therefore i can enjoy it also  along with the delicious pino noir my favorite and the chardonnay  these are delicious with a meal  by themselves or with cheese   as david says  everything is better with cheese  i have on auto  delivery  i wish i could pre order for next year too  very smooth wine  everything they said in the presentation with david and other hosts are spot on  i am enjoying this bundle and you will too  thank you qvc and vintage wine estates  sincerely i bought   of the wine collections  one in the mixed of white   red and one in the all reds  the only one we thought was somewhat decent was the chardonnay  the funny thing is  we aren t even chardonnay drinkers  we both thought that one was the only consumable wine  still bad but the best of the whole lot of wines  rose was the next best but very tart  pulling slightly sour and not in a good way  both the pinot   cab sauv were very sour  almost like corked wine tastes  it burned when you drank it  like you were drinking straight rubbing alcohol  gross  we brought them to the correct temp  let them breathe  etc  but they are just straight up nasty  was a big disappointment as we were really looking forward to getting them and being on auto delivery  i m giving   stars since the packaging of wine in the boxes   the shipping was great as well as qvc customer service  i called   explained everything to qvc and immediately received a refund  no hassles  questions  etc  just immediately refunded the   payments i already made  while the wines disappointed  qvc did not  thank you qvc  this is exactly why i will remain a loyal shopper i consider myself a wine lover but i m not a wine snob  i decided to finally order wine from qvc and went for the mixed case as i do like reds and whites  after trying each variety  i regret the decision  while not horrible  they aren t good either  these aren t wines i d serve to anyone or drink again let alone purchase again  the ros  is a sweet wine no doubt about it  which isn t my taste  but it was described as being not too sweet  the chardonnay is the strangest tasting chardonnay i ve ever tasted  it was described as not being too oaky  i guess i like my chardonnay oaky  and the pinot noir  which the  wine expert  repeatedly mispronounced  red flag  was just bland  the cabernet sauvingnon was supposed to be the best of the bunch and it was private reserve after all but just turned out to be disappointing as well  these wines were touted as having a retail value of   per bottle but taste more like sub   per bottle  which is exactly how much it works out to when you buy the case  you get what you pay for  as they say  and if something sounds too good to be true  it probably is  lessons learned in this case got this for the nice variety it offered  rose is nice  not too sweet not too dry  pinot noir is average  nothing special or outstanding and i wouldn t get it again  chardonnay is awful  maybe just the bottle we opened  but it immediately smelled spoiled and tasted the same  wound up pouring it down the drain and hoping the next two bottles aren t rotten as well  have not tried the cab yet as it s my favorite type of wine and i hate to be disappointed hoping we ll be two for four at least  sorry to say next time i ll pass we are still sampling each one   so far favorite is the chardonnay  but that can change i just received my collection  i opened the rose and it was very tasty  this rose is not overly sweet and that was my main concern  it has a light fruity taste and pairs well with cheeses  i haven t tasted the others yet  but this is a great deal for the quantity you receive  i will continue to update as i open the others this whole order was a nightmare from day one  after almost   weeks it came i wish it didn t i gifted   bottles to my son   when he sent me a text how awful it was   that he dumped it down the drain i was horrified to say the least  luckily it was my son because i bought these for holiday gifts  qvc needs more quality control for items like this we work hard for our money   spending it on something

for four at least  sorry to say next time i ll pass i love the size and the price on this cooler  however the lower quality than brand name coolers is evident in the finish on this cooler  after about   weeks of use the rope handle pulled loose while lifting and the cooler fell to the ground but survived the fall  trademark innovations  please send me new plastic handles i bought a case of his reds   from qvc right before christmas  i was extremely disappointed with my purchase as were my dinner guests  it is always better to sample a wine before making a purchasing  a lesson learned never ordered wine thru mail but so glad i did  i was pleasantly surprised   i will be ordering again this wine is quite good and i am glad i have this on auto delivery  it is robust and smooth  if you enjoy red wine  this ones for you i like full bodied but smooth red  the meritage is a perfect blend of the things i love in red wine  have alternated lately between a pinot noir and cab  this is delicious and perfectly priced i knew that kevin o leary loved good wine  well  let me tell you  he also makes some delicious wine  i purchased the  bottle chardonnay and it is wonderful  i m no wine expert  but i know what i like  i enjoy white wine but i don t like sweet  which is why i didn t try the moscato  i like to enjoy a nice glass of white wine whenever i feel like it  this wine is delightful by the glass   no food necessary  i m very pleased with my purchase and even more pleased that i purchased it on auto delivery  i can t wait for my next shipment  i highly recommend this wine  mr  wonderful will not let you down i have ordered wines from o leary before  i love red wine  but this red wine is awesome  more smooth than cabernet  and cab is usually my first choice  that was ok but this this this one   auto delivery for sure bought the wine for my son for a christmas present  was very skeptical at first  first  i myself really don t care for wine  leaves a nasty after taste and bitter to me  plus after drinking   glass of red  i wake up with a severe headache  well anyway my son open a bottle  i had ordered all red  i went over to see if i could with stand the smell  totally surprised i could  so i decided to try it  very smooth  no after taste  not a strong  bitter smell  had guests over for new year s eve and they had enjoyed it just as much as i did and my son  probably will be ordering again disappointed with the taste and consistency of these wines  my husband and i were looking forward to sharing them with friends on christmas eve  we tried the four variety to be fair and were not satisfied planning to send the rest back i too was skeptical on ordering wines on line  i figured meh  i love wine how bad could it be  i was surprised  very smooth  flavorful with a beautiful nose i was a little skeptical about purchasing wine from qvc  but i ve been very surprised by the quality of this wine collection  i ordered the mixed auto delivery package  the moscato was indeed sweet  just like you d expect from a moscato  and the syrah was not too bad  i guess i should have said from the outset that i m a sweet wine drinker  i like sweet red wines  so the red was not to my liking because it was too dry  i never drink chardonnay because they are likewise too dry for me  but  kevin o leary s chardonnay is my favorite from the entire order  it is awesome  magnificent  and very tasty  i even ordered some fettuccine just so i could pair it with the chardonnay  great find  for me  i m so glad i ordered the auto delivery because i can t wait to see what i get in the spring  very good wine  mr  o leary i belong to other clubs but bought this because of the free shipping  i do not like rose wine and was sure i d hate it but it is excellent  a slight sweet taste very slight  it is a little effervescent too  i forgot where i bought it and googled it to buy more   it runs   for   bottles  not expensive but not   a bottle either  i have not had the others but i am anxious to taste them you get what you pay for  i got it for   a bottle and that s about all it is worth  i should of known better  but it s free s h  i was disappointed it s all from the same vintner and not as the labels show different wineries  it was just the ease of delivery  i live in california and have so many options of good wines  one and only purchase  q does not know good wines we had four friends over tonight for dinner  they loved this wine  hands down the mascato was the favorite  there were no complaints about the chardonnay at all but the first choice was the mascato  they were very excited to find out that more was on the way with auto delivery my kids love them  so no complaints but i m sure they are not healthy of course easy and quick to serve  brings a smile to their faces  pretty good value for a quick drink product worked great kids loved them walmart used to carry a swiss water decaf coffee that had excellent flavor  i ve been looking for a replacement since they quit selling it in the store so and purchased this coffee  though i liked the flavor of the sam s coffee a bit better  this coffee is pretty good as well  it has a fine ground and medium dark roast great decaf coffee using swiss water process  i won t buy anything that is decaf using traditional methods good stuff  really it is real good for the price and i will reorder from this vendor these wines were a happy surprise  i bought an assortment of wines for a house warming party last weekend and these were great  white cat was like a sweet mascoto  cabin fever had a sweet taste all it own  i red cat was also sweet  i don t care for red wine but this was good  the breathable berry reminded me of a sangria this brand is on the top of my list  i will buy more of their wines excellent wines and customer service  i sent them as a gift and they loved it all arrived safe and sound  only tried one bottle so far  mighty tasty absolutely delicious  it was the perfect holiday gift  my in laws loved it great wine and price loved every bottle  will order again red cat is my favorite wine of all time the red cat itself is sweet but not too much so  with a little tartness the white cat is light and refreshing especially ice cold  same goes with the cabin fever the best out of the   in my opinion though is bramble berry  tart  sweet and tastes like berry jam  i love it nicely done  wine tastes good and the chocolate that comes in the packing is delicious  they could have however printed the brand name in a smaller font on the glass  the current font size is too large to be used when inviting guests i had to chase down delivery since you have to sign for it  not an issue  the gift set was beautiful and a lot for the price  i purchase this for my boss who is leaving the company  she loved it  i would buy this again definitely  naked winery just gained a new customer naked cab is by far one of my favorite red wines out there  woody with depth and complexity and notes of black currant  this is one fabulous wine  i love that this gift set is all inclusive   a big dark chocolate bar and   very nice wine glasses  your recipient will think you spent a fortune on this gift box  comes very nicely packaged in a black box  festive crinkle and tissue paper fill and fun things like a bumper sticker and tattoos  great buy  love this set i purchased two of these as holiday gifts  the price seemed just right for a bottle of wine  glasses and chocolate  in fact  even without glasses  this would ve been a good value to ship across country  i was skeptical about how nicely the presentation would look in person but the recipients sent a picture and i was floored  it looks gorgeous  and expensive  i can t speak to the quality of the wine  but as far as the overall gift  i am pleased that the recipients are pleased and would purchase again  however  as another reviewer noted and that i did not read before purchasing  there was some risqu little cards included in the gift box that boldly stated let s get naked referring i m sure to the name of the winery  and also i truly did not even notice the silhouettes of women on the glasses or the tag line we aim to tease on the glasses  which is my fault  but i have to say i did not like that  i feel a bit embarrassed now as i hope the recipients don t confuse my intentions  fortunately these gifts went to couples with a sense of humor about it but had i sent this to someone more conservative in my life  i would have been so very  very embarrassed cabernet and chocolate  win win  this wine is such an easy drinking cab that it is hard not to buy it any time it s available  let alone when it is on special  combine it with glasses and some chocolate my date night is made this wine is the best cab for the money i ve ever had  sometimes a   cab tastes like a   cab  and that s a bargain wine for sure  this washington cabernet sauvignon from naked winery drinks like a   cabernet  so try it now  this is not a fruity oak bomb  nor a lengthy  earthy  subtle cab here are my  liner tasting notes black currant and dark cherry on the nose lead to hints of clove and praline on the palate  medium tannins  an elegant  smoky barrel toast on the finish bought this for my daughter in law  she loved it bought this for sis in law s birthday  love the winery i will never order again   two buck chuck  has better taste the wine was excellent ordered the moscato  and auto delivery  second order i switched to white zinfandel it was delicious also we ordered   bottles of the moscato on auto delivery  so glad we did  it s different but we love it very good  nice flavor  receiving reds on auto delivery i am originally from france love red wine i didn t think i will love it but as a surprise  it s a great wine for the price i recommend you gave kevin s wine a try delivery was a little slow but it was worth the wait  i was very pleased with the moscato selection  it arrived in excellent condition  which indicates it was well packaged  the price was very reasonable i have tried this wine before  but this batch was not good at all and i will never order again knowing that wine taste varies  have to say i really enjoy the moscato  i find it very refreshing  with a great flavor  i chose the auto delivery  and share with my sister  who also enjoys and looks forward to when the next delivery is due i ve only tried the chardonnay  so my review is for that wine  i find it very good when chilled properly  i take it out of the refrigerator an hour before drinking it   it s perfect  it s not to cold or warm  when drunk too cold  it doesn t have much taste  at the proper temp  it becomes much more complex  it has a clean delicate taste of peach   apricot  it s not a heavy chardonnay  no oak  butter or vanilla undertone  i prefer this crisper  fresher chardonnay  the heavy ones make me gag don t know why others have given such bad reviews  i guess each person has their own taste but i love the moscato   my family   friends also enjoy it i m not a wine drinker but have relatives and friends who are  so i purchased   bottles to have on hand at home and also for gifts  my brother visited this weekend and i opened the red wine for him to enjoy during a football game  he tried to be gracious but finally said it just wasn t good  now i m wondering what the people thought who received wine as gifts  i have eight bottles left and wondering if i should just pour them down the drain  what a disappointment after the hosts all ooo ed and ahhh ed over this supposedly fabulous wine assortment i have order three cases over past two years a great wine for the price point  other reviews i have read judge this to harshly  including shipping it is a twelve dollar a bottle wine  i have order many wines for an average of   a bottle and not nearly as good    i order   cases of wine a least every year  this is a great value in the price range it sells for i am not a wine expert  but i am italian and like wine  i ordered the white selection and i absolutely love it  i enjoy a glass of wine without the meal attached  my first time ordering moscato and it is delicious  next favorite is the white zinfandel  the chardonnay is also very good  kevin did an excellent job mixing the favors  i am on auto delivery so i am able to give them as nice gifts  but not the moscato we ordered   white and   red twice  really like them  sweet is not a favorite  but it was good thought this would be a good sampler of wine at a very decent price  the mixed case has some wine that friends liked  some i liked  but overall the case is just non descript  chardonnay was very light on the oaky taste  other whites were ok  meritage is ok  pinot noir was unidentifiable as such  cab sauv  ok  white zin  no one wanted it  so i can t say this was a  wonderful  assortment  i have cancelled the remainder of the auto ship  thanks anyway  kevin  i ll pick my own bottles locally not the quality at all that i was expecting from kevin o leary  very disappointed  and i would not serve this to guests definitely not worth the hassle  don t waste your time or your money the cab was the only drinkable one  using for cooking wine  for that reason  mr wonderful  i m out first  before i purchase a wine for a second time i need to sample it  not possible this way of course so i relied on qvc and kevin o leary s reputation for making my purchase so far i have been very pleased with the quality and taste of each of the reds in the collection  a great value for the quality and proud to serve it to guests  look forward to next auto ship and purchasing the white collection love love love kevin s reserve wines  just the best   th or  th time ordering and will continue to order more and auto delivery  fantastic deal on really great wine  can t go wrong  a no brainer  if you love wine do it had this wine for a few months and finally got around to tasting we ordered the   bottle sampler set and we are loving the chardonnay and the syrah cannot wait to taste the others will order again i m not a wine snob but i ve had my fair share of wine over the years  i taste new brands fairly regularly  you can do much better at your local store for the same or less money  basically tastes like a good box wine  black box   etc the cabernet is a true value  the chardonnay is also great we have ordered both white and red sets of o leary wines more than once  and we have had consistently excellent wine with every single bottle the sweet wines are delicate and blended perfectly without being too sweet  the rich reds are deep without being too tannic or biting  when we need a wine we can count on to be perfect for guests  or gifts or just enjoying with our everyday meals  this is our go to wine we recommend it highly i purchased these to give as gifts last year and when i tried the wine myself i spit it out and was mortified i was so embarrassed that i gave these wines to people i know that i had to apologize and give another gift this is by far some of the worst swill i ve ever had there are wines that are the same price from california wineries that are far superior i would not even cook with this stuff i wish i had discovered the poor quality and the offensive taste during the return period because they would have gone back  this is what they had in mind when they coined the expression  rot gut if you re a selective wine drinker  don t buy this  it s mediocre at best  will likely end up using for cooking i wish i had returned this wine  but only gradually used and each bottle was less than satisfying  have ordered vintage wine estates wine a few times before and very much enjoyed  o lerary s reserve wines were not of the same quality in my opinion and in the opinion of my book club members  not sure if they were left in the heat somewhere along the way or just what  but just no happy with these and would not order again  kevin presents himself as quite the wine producer and he is likely quite knowledgeable  but there is better wine available at lower cost purchased on auto delivery  first shipment great  second came with   bottle of sav but no moscato  we do not like the sav but are now stuck with all these bottles  third shipment came with the moscato and   more sav  shipped well before they said it would or at least they said in process so we could not delay or skip shipment  moscato is great others are ok  trying to cancel balance and would order the moscato and other whites but price with shipping even  included  makes it costly  disappointed i m really picky about wine  to be honest  i ve had cheap wine that is good and more expensive wine that is not good  a good wine to me has a good balance  i actually really really liked the moscato  moscato is my favorite type of wine and i ve had a lot that i don t care for  if you like bartenura  you will appreciate this  i liked the white zin also  i didn t care for the chardonnay  but my husband said it was  ok  i d like to get the   bottle pack that you can choose  but the current price makes the   bottle pack more expensive per bottle  i d say all in all  this is a decent middle of the road group of wines  the moscato impressed me the most  for those who haven t heard of the bartenura comparison  it s a   bottle  so it puts it right in about the same class as o leary  if you re curious about this  if say take a chance  regardless how i feel about the taste of the chardonnay  they are all quite fragrant which i enjoy i purchased the   bottle mixed package to sample something new to me in the rose and meritage  i usually drink pinot noir and chardonnay or pinot grigio  i wish the wines lived up to their descriptions  but sadly they did not  i realize tastes are subjective  but for me  the chardonnay was very tart and without any full taste  i would not order these again i am a pinot noir wine drinker generally  but the pinot noir in this case is terrible  even after decanting  have tried two of the pinot bottles and a few of each of the others  i actually prefer the cab over anything in the case and i usually don t like cabs can t believe that i was so stupid to fall for kevin o leary s promotion of his wines  i believed in him  and therefore went ahead and purchased the variety dozen bottles  what a fool i have been  i wanted to give him the benefit of doubt  but i continue to be disappointed  yes  i know i have a month to return the merchandise  what a laugh  how to return a huge package  i poured most in the kitchen sink  live and learn i purchased these to give as gifts last year and when i tried the wine myself i spit it out and was mortified i was so embarrassed that i gave these wines to people i know that i had to apologize and give another gift this is by far some of the worst swill i ve ever had there are wines that are the same price from california wineries that are far superior i would not even cook with this stuff i wish i had discovered the poor quality and the offensive taste during the return period because they would have gone back  this is what they had in mind when they coined the expression  rot gut i am more of a dry wine person  but i have enjoyed the chardoney and rose  not to sweet  not to dry  great gifts my friends said they enjoyed i was really hopeful that i would experience a new tasting wine just because it s  mr  wonderful s  brand  however it was not as flavorful as what i had become accustomed  it s not bad it s just okay  i purchased the zinfandel  i wanted the moscato but it had sold out  i still may go back later and purchase it because it might be exactly what i m looking to purchase  i would still recommend this product because everyone has a different expectation when it comes to wine tasting i purchased the pinot noir and it was terrible  dumping it and won t purchase again  i only like sweet  not super sweet  wine and the moscato is absolutely delicious  i m not one to drink it with the suggested food pairings  i ll have it with anything because it tastes that good  like it before  during  or after dinner  it just tastes great  this is really good wine and the price is good too this is the best vine i have ever tasted  i had to reorder me a second round very unique tast i love it you won t go wrong with this i have ordered the set of   in the past  i have tried them all and enjoyed allhowever white zinfandel is my favorite  i have given them as gifts with no complaints just compliments  soooo smooth i only like a sweet wine  i was skeptical on ordering without tasting it first  i am so glad i ordered it  i love it  thanks kevin o leary i ordered a   bottle set of both the meritage   moscata wines for friends who did me a huge favor and most definitely know their wines  they called me to say they thought these were both the best they had tasted in awhile   said they were thoroughly enjoying them and when they finished this set planned to order these   bottle sets on their own as they want to try all varieties   thanks kevin   qvc for a hit  i ordered the white zinfadel in the   bottle selection which arrived on friday  this wine is absolutely one of the best i have ever had the pleasure of tasting  my husband and i visited nappa wine valley and sonoma wineries about   years ago  our hats off to mr  kevin o leary to bring such a joy  a truly inspired new one which can certainly hold it s own  we had company yesterday and everyone remarked as to how well it is done  thank you so much for this wonderful offering this was my first purchase of these wines  tried the moscato as i like a sweet wine  found it to be the best i ve ever had  the only drawback to ordering wine on line is having to be home for the delivery  missed the ups guy a couple times i don t know why the negative reviews said the wine tasted horrible  i should have ordered a case  mr  wonderful  you have not promised what you haven t delivered  fold with this wine  i ought to go on auto ship with the case'"
